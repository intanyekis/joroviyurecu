I had the chance to meet my hero Chris Jericho. My grandmother, the woman that raised me, my big momma got me front row tickets to meet you. And what did you do Chris? You walked past that old lady, told her to shut up, looked at me and told me to sit my ass down. 25 years Chris! I held on that frustration. A seven-year-old child! But I swore Chris, I swore, the day I got to look you dead in your eye, I was going to hurt you over and over, and over, and over. As I looked at you Chris, you were lifeless. So what did I do? I picked your ass up and Spinebustered you. And gave you a Spinebuster after Spinebuster after Spinebuster,” Will Hobbs said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Powerhouse Hobbs is also a one-time AEW TNT Champion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqa29raWK9sMPEq5%2BoraOaeqm7wZuqZp2opbmitc2sZKGho2KvprHFZq6irJhisKm%2ByKxko52inrCpuw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
