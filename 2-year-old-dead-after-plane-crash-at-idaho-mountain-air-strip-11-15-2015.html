The family is from Utah, but their names were not released.</p><p>Two men in the lower plane, both from the Roseburg, Ore., region, suffered non-life-threatening injuries, according to the sheriff's office. They were taken to a hospital in McCall.</p><p>The planes' tail numbers haven't been released.</p><p>Johnson Creek Airport has a grass runway and is a popular spot for backcountry aviation enthusiasts seeking access to mountainous terrain near the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness. The 3,400-foot runway, located at 4,933 feet above sea level, is surrounded by densely forested mountains.</p><p>The airport has been the site of numerous crashes, including accidents in 1996, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2010, according to a review of National Transportation Safety Board records documenting mishaps at the field.</p><p>Friday's accident occurred during a national fly-in of backcountry enthusiasts that runs through Sunday. More than 70 planes were lining both sides of the 150-foot-wide strip.</p><p>The crash occurred near the north end of the landing strip.</p><p>The NTSB will be the lead investigator into the cause of the collision, the FAA said.</p><p>Mike Pape, the aeronautics division administrator at the Idaho Transportation Department, was also flying to the crash site Friday afternoon.</p><p>The agency oversees Johnson Creek Airport and 30 other state-owned backcountry airstrips. Johnson Creek is easily the state's most popular, said Mel Coulter, a spokesman at ITD in Boise.</p><p>"As with all of our backcountry air strips, it requires a different level of skills and confidence to fly in and out of" Johnson Creek, Coulter said.</p><p>The airport remains open, but there could be restrictions, he said.</p><p>Valley County Sheriff Patti Bolen, whose offices in Cascade are about 50 miles southwest of the crash site, said in a statement her agency received a 911 call just minutes after the two planes went down.</p><p>The Beechcraft Baron is a twin-engine piston aircraft capable of flying 236 mph. Piper Tri-pacers belong to a class of four-seat, high-wing aircraft built into the 1960s.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihlJa1sLrEsKpnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxmpaeTlrlwfoyynJqqXaS5pXnDnpidZZGbwaa%2BjKmjmqaVYrCzrdKhZJqsXZ6xorTOZqSorZ6prqq6jJqgq2Wjqb%2BqvIxqaGZpZWJ%2FcX2U</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
