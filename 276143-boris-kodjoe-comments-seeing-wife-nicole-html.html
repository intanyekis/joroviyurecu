So it did not surprise many when he was observed expressing his mind in her comment section.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/0d9e5d103296c6aa3e70e7b205ea7b25.png><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Boris Kodjoe as Andy on the third season of the show "Station 19" | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The talented woman had shared a throwback picture of herself that captured her in a car wearing a skimpy top that showed some cleavage. She wore ripped jeans and had her hair dyed blonde.</p><p class=dh>It was a great look which is why Nicole <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CSemjcvrtDX/>expressed </a>a desire to recreate the hair color in her caption. Shortly after the post went live, Boris joined many who flocked to the comment section to express their opinions.</p><p class=dh>While many went on and on about how gorgeous she looked, Boris opted to use flame emojis to express himself, most likely a subtle way of giving his approval for her proposed hairstyle.</p><p class=dh>If nothing else, it proved exactly how dedicated and aware they are of each other, which in turn explains how the two have kept their relationship afloat for nearly two decades. Here are a few important things to note about the couple.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>THEY MADE OUT WHEN THEY FIRST MET</strong></p><p class=dh>Boris and Nicole had been <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/celebrity/black-celeb-couples/11-things-you-didnt-know-about-boris-kodjoe-and-nicole-ari-parker-love/>working together</a> on "Soul Food" for about two years before their relationship took off. In fact, the first time they met, he made out with her in front of the cameras.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>They spent the day frolicking on the streets, having fun, just like teenagers would.</strong></h3><p class=dh>Their first date was in the year 2002, and it did not go down at a fancy restaurant; instead, they attended the Arthur Ashe Foundation Gala in New York City. They went on to get married in 2005 and now have two children they dote on.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>THAT YEAR NICOLE REVEALED TOO MUCH</strong></p><p class=dh>Nicole and Boris's relationship is one of the hottest and long-lived in the entertainment world; however, that does not exempt their paradise from experiencing occasional storms now and then.</p><p class=dh>An example of such a storm was the one they encountered in 2020. At the time, Nicole started a controversy when she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://blackamericaweb.com/2020/04/13/nicole-ari-parker-reveals-boris-kodjoe-isnt-as-romantic-anymore-video/>implied </a>that the embers of their flame might be burning low.</p><p class=dh>Apparently, she felt he was not doing enough and had begun to get so comfortable; he stopped doing things that made her feel like his girlfriend.</p><p class=dh>This made her feel disconnected from him, and she was very candid about it in a video that began to circulate as the controversy gained steam.</p><p class=dh>She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/B-zokYsJYyR/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=8708f7fe-dfb4-483b-aacb-2d2a0de3abab">said</a>, "I don't necessarily want to be single, but I miss the single life. I miss the text messages for no reason. I miss the coming up behind me when I'm scrambling eggs and just kissing me on the back of the neck."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/addd8265b52c5bfd1cc7bd84dd7ce22f.png><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Boris Kodjoe's comment on his wife, Nicole Ari Parker's Instagram post | Photo: Instagram/ nicoleariparker</p><p class=dh>Boris did not look too happy about what his wife was saying in the video, but he held his tongue until netizens started to link Nicole's statement to possible infidelity. Then, he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://blackamericaweb.com/2020/04/15/boris-kodjoe-marriage-trouble-rumors/>clamped </a>down on the narrative with a long message he shared via Instagram.</p><p class=dh>The statement discredited talks of a breakup, and above all, it showed that Boris had listened to his wife complain and had chosen to work on his shortcomings because he ended the writeup by <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B--9iYnh-L5/>declaring</a> that he would be "kissing the back of her neck for no reason."</p><p class=dh>That seems to be working out well for the couple because things seem to be back to normal between them. <a class="me a" href=#>Boris </a>has been doing more, and when they <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.bet.com/style/living/2020/05/22/boris-kodjoe-and-nicole-ari-parker-beach-anniversary.html>celebrated </a>their anniversary this year, it was clear that the two were still very much in love with each other.</p><p class=dh>They spent the day frolicking on the streets, having fun, just like teenagers would. Fans hope their love works out in the end.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtub2lkaHqju9Giqmajn5m3sLGMnKampZWjwbR50p6coqaXYsSqssRmpaKbn6Gyb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
