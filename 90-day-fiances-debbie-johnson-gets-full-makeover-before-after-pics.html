I got new hair style. I have long hair, red hair. I also have a tattoo — brand new,” the reality star, 69, exclusively told Us Weekly about her new look. “I’ve never had one before. First time at almost 70 years old. It’s exciting. So, a little Botox here and there and all set.”</p><p>Debbie, who was first <a href=#>introduced as <strong>Colt Johnson</strong>‘s mom</a> on season 6 of 90 Day Fiancé in 2018, is set to return to reality TV on<a href=#> the upcoming season of The Single Life</a>, putting herself out there for the first time after being widowed for 13 years. Debbie and Colt’s father, Harley Johnson, were married for 27 years before his death.</p><p>During the season, fans will watch as Debbie quickly learns how much the dating world has changed through blind dates and dating apps. However, she’s hopeful she can find love.</p><p>“I decided to sort of start my life over and take it seriously, you might say, and see what’s out there and give it a shot,” she told Us. “So they let me be on Single Life to see how it goes.”</p><p>The 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? alum explained that she wanted to “reinvent” herself ahead of The Single Life and “go back to me being me instead of her mom type of deal.”</p><p>She added, “So I wanted to be the more feminine, sexy [me]. I guess you can be sexy at 70. I had a lot of people making suggestions of what I should do. So I was very open to anything anybody had to say. … I do [feel sexy].”</p><p>Debbie noted that Colt, 36, approves of her new look.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He’s proud of me for going back out there and giving it a shot,” she said of stepping back into the dating scene after 40 years. “<a href=#>Colt [is] married</a>. He’s fine with <a href=#><strong>Vanessa [Guerra]</strong>.</a> They get along really good, they have a good marriage. I thought, ‘This is the perfect time to leave home, get back out there.’ The reason I decided to do The Single Life is because there aren’t a lot of people on the show that are my age. It’s difficult for people, especially at my age, to get back out there. They don’t know how to do it. I thought, ‘Maybe if I can teach a few people, they won’t be so negative about trying it out again.’”</p><p>Scroll down for more photos of Debbie and watch her reveal her new look on the finale of 90 Day Bares All, streaming on discovery+ Sunday, October 31. 90 Day: The Single Life begins streaming Friday, November 12.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq19ufW6wwLJkn6GRo7Cmv4ydnJuamZp6q7vHp6qopl2csrW%2FjJ%2BspaRdoq6ssc6vnKtlkpqzsL7EZpifrJWnerG1wqxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
