They enjoy vintage classics as well as recent collectibles like the Rolls-Royce Phantom VIII and a Silver Cloud III. Those two vehicles alone cost the superstars over $1 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-jenner>Kylie Jenner</h2><p>Each member of <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Kardashian clan</a> seems to have some classic and luxurious cars at their disposal, but what makes Jenner's Rolls-Royce Ghost special is the custom scarlet leather interior and starlight roof. According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Things</a>, with the additional add-ons, her purchase ran the mogul around $450,000.</p><h2 id=shaquille-o-neal>Shaquille O’Neal</h2><p>The former basketball legend has not only been known to have a massive car collection, but he's not opposed to gifting the classics to others in the past. Shaq owns a 17-car garage, which houses a Rolls-Royce Phantom, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">customized for his massive build</a>. In 2020, the former NBA star had his Phantom customized to include an image of him and late Laker's legend Kobe Bryant on the car's hood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">The Most Coveted Cars From Ron Pratte's Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=simon-cowell>Simon Cowell</h2><p>The 'American Idol' alum and 'America's<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Got Talent</a>'&nbsp;judge is worth an estimated $550 million. He's also a car collector and enjoys driving around town in his Silver Cloud III. This particular model is one of the best in the vintage collection, as just 2,000 units were produced. In addition, Cowell boasts two Rolls-Royce Phantoms in his collection, among many others. One of the Phantoms alone is estimated to be worth more than $500,000.</p><h2 id=floyd-mayweather-jr>Floyd Mayweather Jr.</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">superstar boxer</a> likes to win both in and out of the ring. He's been known to pay cash for his luxury vehicles, and his current collection is worth upwards of $1 million – almost all of which is Rolls-Royce. According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Did You Know Cars</a>, Mayweather's Phantom VIII is rumored to cost more than $400,000.</p><h2 id=queen-latifah>Queen Latifah</h2><p>She used to drive around in a Mercedes-Benz (stolen in 2016), but her new classic car is a $370,000 Rolls-Royce Phantom. It's worth triple what the Benz cost her, but it appears she's enjoying the custom features and classy ride.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jay-leno>Jay Leno</h2><p>The former <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">late-night host and comedian </a>have shown off his classic car collection numerous times over the years. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot Cars</a> estimates his massive showroom to be worth more than $50 million, among them two matching 1937 Rolls-Royce Chassis.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez>Jennifer Lopez</h2><p>The singer, actress, and the superstar has been seen traveling in her black Rolls-Royce Ghost for ultimate comfort and amenities. The estimated worth is around $320,000, but according to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Money Inc</a>., customizations can drain the bank of nearly $600,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gwen-stefani>Gwen Stefani</h2><p>She's the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">frontwoman to rock band 'No Doubt</a>', a newlywed to country music star Blake Shelton and an avid Rolls-Royce fan. Stefani routinely travels around town in her Wraith, worth somewhere between $300,000 and $600,000 based on customized requests. Stefani has a bright blue version and totes her three children to and from events in the classic car.</p><h2 id=jamie-foxx>Jamie Foxx</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Actor and singer <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Jamie Foxx </a>owns a Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe, worth $500,000. He must be attached to the collectable car; back in 2015, Foxx dropped around $20,000 for a new paint job and additional upgrades. The color changed from black to a satin white finish, tan interior and 24-inch Giovanna Rims.</p><h2 id=david-beckham>David Beckham</h2><p>The former soccer superstar has been seen driving his kids around in his $407,000 Phantom Drophead Coupe. Called the 'Holy Grail' of luxury automobiles, it's not surprising that the Rolls is at the top of his list in a <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">large car collection</a>. With convertible top and rearward opening coach doors, no wonder this model sets itself apart from others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=50-cent>50 Cent</h2><p>With several Rolls-Royce's in his collection already, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50 Cent went all out</a> with the Cullinan, Rolls' first SUV with all-wheel drive.
