The <a href=#>business conglomerate that owns luxurious fashion brands</a> from Gucci to Saint Laurent and Balenciaga, François-Henri Pinault, is the husband of Eternals actress Salma Hayek. The couple has known each other since 1992 but did not start dating until 2007.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The French fashion magnate, François-Henri Pinault, has been married to Hollywood actress Salma Hayek since 2009, and the two on the cusp of unparalleled success in their respective careers. François-Henri Pinault is the son of one of the wealthiest people in the world, François Pinault, and he has been diligently working his way up to take over the French luxury conglomerate which owns the fashion houses Balenciaga, Gucci, Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta. Aside from the fashion brands, they also own the French winery Chateau Latour and auction house Christie’s.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Ashley Judd And Salma Hayek Talk Forgiveness In Wake Of Weinstein Scandal</a></span></p><h2 id=get-to-know-the-couple>Get To Know The Couple</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hollywood actress Salma Hayek has openly told the press that she was smitten with her husband of 12 years, François-Henri Pinault. However she is understandably protective of him and their relationship when it comes to sharing vital information about their romance. The world was even surprised when Hayek announced in March 2007 that she was already engaged and is already expecting which <a href=#>took her fans by surprise</a>. They welcomed their beautiful daughter, Valentina Paloma, on September 2007 and tied the knot discreetly on the Valentine’s Day of 2009. The marriage was just a simple event that took place at the 6th Arrondissement City Hall in Paris</p><p>Their marriage ceremony may be simple but they did not forego the opportunity to have a star-studded wedding party, the couple had another wedding ceremony held <a href=#>at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice</a> on April of the same year. The couple chose that specific location because it is exactly where they met in 2006 at the gala that was hosted by Pinault. Their meeting was spectacular and such an amazing story according to the Hollywood actress but she chose not to disclose the details of their meeting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=luxurious-lifestyle-with-extravagant-vacations>Luxurious Lifestyle with Extravagant Vacations</h2><p>Although François-Henri Pinault has always been part of one of the most influential families in their country, it was only until Hayek announced their engagement in 2007 that he got attention from those who are outside the fashion industry. Ever since the two got married in 2009, François-Henri Pinault has been spoiling his wife and their 14 year old daughter. It is pretty apparent that François-Henri Pinault loves showering Hayek with<a href=#> luxurious vacations to picturesque places.</a> One of the most notable surprise of Pinault to Hayek was their Bora Bora trip in 2018 where he surprised her with another vow renewal and disguised it as just a typical spa day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even the pandemic did not stop the couple from traveling as they escaped the madness of the world and headed to Greece to have a spectacular vacation. Greece is known to be one of the most popular destinations for couples and Pinault and Hayek have been going back to the country to have a breathe of fresh air.</p><h2 id=the-secret-to-their-12-years-of-loving-marriage>The Secret To Their 12 Years Of Loving Marriage</h2><p>The Hollywood actress said that one of the reasons that they have a lasting relationship is because they have never said anything nasty towards each other which mean that they do not have any resentment for each other. When it comes to building life together, Salma Hayek believes that still has a life outside your marriage but always make sure to prioritize each other. When their daughter was born, <a href=#>Hayek felt that she does not want to work</a> anymore, but her husband suggested to her that she needs to go back to work no matter what. Pinault said to her that they are not putting up some lazy girl in the house and that’s not who he married to. He then said that he does not want to deprive her of doing movies and he wants to watch more of her work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What makes their relationship stable and working is that they still have independence from each other even after marriage. Aside from their respective careers, the two still have separate finances as they both wanted to keep their finances separate. Pinault believes that his expenses from before the marriage should only be his expenses and that has been his system ever since. With this dynamic, they both have respect to each other and no resentments were built.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Look Inside The Simple Life Of Christian Horner And Geri Halliwell</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hola</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Popsugar</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SCMP</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Goalcast</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSubrjOqKJmoZ6otqWxjK2fnmWVrb2mutKirZ5lnZa%2Fs7XAoJxmp5ZiwKK4zJpkoZmpmrhurc2dZJ%2BqkaOwsLXSZp%2BepqKeerG1zZqspaxf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
