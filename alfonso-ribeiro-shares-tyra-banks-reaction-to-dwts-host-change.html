She replaced <a href=#><strong>Tom Bergeron</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Erin Andrews</strong></a>, who previously hosted the show.</p><p>“I’m really focused on business, like, crazy, crazy focused on business. … I think it’s time to graduate from the dance floor to the stock market floor. Mic drop,” she told TMZ when her departure was announced in March. “I feel it’s time for me to really focus on my business and my entrepreneurship. I think it’s time. I think my heart and soul are in my business and in producing TV.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Alfonso-Ribeiro-Reveals-Tyra-Banks-Reaction-to-DWTS-Host-Shakeup-Nothing-But-Love-551.jpg><p>Banks explained that she can’t focus on her SMiZE and Dream ice cream brand and other business ventures while “hosting a show.” Teasing upcoming projects, she noted that fans will get to see her “creating things, not just hosting things.”</p><p>Shortly after Banks’s departure was confirmed, <a href=#>it was announced</a> that <a href=#><strong>Julianne Hough</strong></a> would be <a href=#>taking over the role</a> and joining Ribeiro as the show’s second host.</p><p>Ribeiro, for his part, told Us on Tuesday that he and Hough, 35, are <a href=#>going to be “amazing” together</a>.</p><p>“Our connection is fantastic. I think we’re going to be great together. The energy’s going to be great,” he shared. “I get to move down onto the floor this season and to the old Tom Bergeron role. It’s going to be a lot of fun.”</p><p>Ribeiro explained that he’ll get a chance to talk to the contestants on the dance floor “fresh” after they finish their routines, while Hough will handle things in the DWTS skybox.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Alfonso-Ribeiro-Reveals-Tyra-Banks-Reaction-to-DWTS-Host-Shakeup-Nothing-But-Love-552.jpg><p>“That’s where we start. We’ll see what happens, but yeah, that’s where we’re starting and it’s going to be fun. It’s going to be really awesome to be standing next to them,” he teased to Us. “The love is right here.”</p><p>Overall, Ribeiro <a href=#>has high hopes for this season</a> — which has a star-studded cast including <a href=#><strong>Mauricio Umansky</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jamie Lynn Spears</strong></a>, among others.</p><p>“This is a great cast and the energy is going to be amazing, and I think the heart and the love and the soul of the show will be there for this season and I’m excited,” he gushed. “The anticipation, it’s like it’s real. This is the day that it becomes really real.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>DWTS premieres simultaneously on ABC and Disney+ on Tuesday, September 26, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJilnp%2BjwLB50aKZnqGipHq0tMCrnKxlpK6%2FonnBmqWkq12nsqKv06Kmp2WkpHqlw9OsZKGno6l6pLTAp56eZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
