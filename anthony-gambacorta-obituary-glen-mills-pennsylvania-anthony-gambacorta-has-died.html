Anthony Gambacorta was the first child to be born to his parents, Anthony Gambacorta and Edith (Tarolla) Gambacorta. He was born in Brooklyn, New York. The family made the move to Levittown, which is located on Long Island, New York, in the year 1952. They spent their entire life there. As an aviation mechanic for TWA airlines, Anthony was employed there.</p><p>After he retired, Anthony followed his lifelong interest in autos by opening Anthony’s Auto Sales in the town of Massapequa in the state of New York. Anthony was a dealer of historic and exotic automobiles, and his inventory included Pantaras, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Corvettes, Cobras, and Vipers, among others. His favorite was a Chevrolet Corvette from the year 1959.</p><p>In addition to that, he restored a number of motorcycles. When he started having a lot of health problems, he uprooted his life and traveled to Ohio, where he had family, and he entrusted his cousin Anthony C. DeGenaro to take care of all of his medical problems. Anthony had a generous spirit, and he helped others in his New York community who were in need. He was appreciative of the many acts of kindness given to him as his health declined, and he gave to those who were in need. Rosemarie, Anthony’s mother and father, as well as his sister, all passed away before Anthony. His cousins all over the Youngstown region and his lifelong friends in the city of Levittown on Long Island, New York, will always carry fond memories of him with them, and he will continue to have a place in their hearts.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwrc2tn6imqWK0ornBmpqoqqSWerCuyK2smqqpYrStsc1mpKKknKh6sbHNp6qypKaWu6qtjJqlraCfo8Zus8CmmZqbn6fBonnHmqpmnJmasXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
