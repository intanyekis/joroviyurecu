Gunn Got a Second Shot But MissedThe Nepalese-American singer came to national attention when he first appeared on the eighteenth season of the ABC singing show and went neck to neck against Just Sam in the finals.
As an unprecedented move from the show's producers, they opened the stage to last season's top 10 contestants to compete for a spot in the competition this year."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Not all judges came from the same school of thought, though.</p><h2>The Audience Was Divided</h2><p>Katy Perry critiqued that sometimes&nbsp;being an artist meant playing along if only&nbsp;just a little bit. She revealed that she wanted to sing along with him&nbsp;but couldn't because she did not know that melody.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Much like the judges, the audience was squarely divided into two camps. The first group of people found his performance to be absolutely wonderful. But, the second camp's verdict was not so much in his favor.&nbsp;</p><p>"It’s disrespectful to completely change the arrangements of 'In My Place' by Coldplay .. sorry Arthur Gunn I can’t give any vote for you tonight," one fan&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a>. At the same time, another <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">claimed</a> that Gunn was simply being cocky.</p><p>In the same episode, he also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shook</a> the stage with the Lynyrd Skynyrd hit 'Simple Man' for his mother. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The episode came to a close with Gunn being eliminated on May 9, 2021, along with Hunter Metts. The top five contestants now include Grace Kinstler,&nbsp;Willie Spence,&nbsp;Caleb Kennedy,&nbsp;Casey Bishop,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Chayce Beckham.</p><p>Apart from his time on Idol,&nbsp;the artist has been busy churning out albums.&nbsp;On March 22, he released his new album 'Khoj.' This album came&nbsp;after he released 'Self-Titled'&nbsp;in July&nbsp;2020 and the 'Grahan'&nbsp;EP from back in August&nbsp;2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinqKhdmMKtwNSrnGiZoqm1tr6MoKynpl2Wuqa%2ByJyYp2WZmbytedKemKynnmJ%2BenrHraSl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
