“You have to be calm,” he seemed to want to say.
That is how Aurelien Tchouameni, known more familiarly at the club as Tchoua, celebrated his first goal in a Real Madrid shirt in the 3-0 win away to Girona."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Joselu’s fourth league goal of the season gave them the lead in the 17th minute with Tchouameni soon doubling it when he headed in</span><span class=s2>&nbsp;Toni Kroos’ corner to emphasise his importance.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>T</span><span class=s2>he only game in which the 23-year-old midfielder did not start this season was the Madrid derby — the only one in which Ancelotti’s side have lost.</span></p><p>“Above all, I wanted to rest Tchouameni, who had played a lot of games, even taking into account the matches with the national team,” Ancelotti said to justify his decision after the 3-1 defeat against Atletico Madrid.</p><p class=p3><span class=s2>This season, the midfielder has started eight out of nine games. Exactly the same as last season at this stage. However, after the World Cup in Qatar, Tchouameni lost his place in midfield as Ancelotti favoured the experience pairing of Luka Modric and Kroos.</span></p><p>He did not help himself in January, when he traveled to Paris, while injured, to watch an <a class=ath_autolink data-id=3 href=#>NBA</a> game between the Detroit Pistons and the Chicago Bulls while Madrid had another match. Club officials were not impressed, but it was seen as a naive mistake rather than a malicious one and it has not been held against him.</p><p>“I knew what it was like to play for Madrid, the best team in the world. The demands and pressure are very high. What happened in Paris was my mistake, but I’m young and I’m sure it won’t happen again,” he said.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p class=p3><span class=s2>But this year, in line with the club’s strategy of continuing the transition in midfield, the trend is not expected to be the same.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>He was destined to be Casemiro’s successor when the long-serving Brazil midfielder left for Manchester United at the start of last season.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>The Madrid management had already signed Tchouameni for €80million plus add-ons from Monaco in 2022.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>It is an open secret how highly valued Tchouameni is within the club. He is framed as one of those who preferred the white shirt to more money and is dubbed as one of the “phenomenons”, or one of the leaders of the new generation of players who are in the team.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>That is why, despite the interest of Premier League teams this summer after an in and out first season at the Bernabeu, the club is clear: he is not for sale.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>For his part, inside the dressing room, Tchouameni has won the affection of everyone, who define his attitude as very good.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>He does not need to be extroverted; they know Tchouameni has something special: he speaks Spanish fluently because his mother is a teacher of the language and he plays the piano with the same mastery.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Against Girona he distributed 46 successful passes out of a possible 50, but where he excelled the most was in his work without the ball, usually placed between the central defenders, Nacho and Antonio Rudiger.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>From there, he helped Camavinga in his challenge on the left flank and tried to cut all of Girona’s transitions with seven recoveries and three tackles won.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>In the 81st minute and the game long over, Girona poured into Kepa Arrizabalaga’s area, but Tchouameni was intent on ensuring the clean sheet with the best of his clearances.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Ten minutes earlier, following one of his recoveries, Tchouameni was able to give a key pass to Joselu in the build up to Jude Bellingham’s goal which completed the scoring.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p class=p3><span class=s2>At that point, Bellingham took the spotlight again and asked Tchouameni for some space to do his typical celebration with his arms outstretched.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>But far from frowning, Tchouameni stood back to enjoy the moment in the background.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>He knew that was exactly his role — as he does every week in the team now.&nbsp;</span></p><p>(Top photo: Antonio Villalba/<a class=ath_autolink data-id=658 href=#>Real Madrid</a> via Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k3JocG1na3xzfJFsZmpoX2V%2FcK3Uq5yloZWjerWvx6ismqWVo7ZuvsSao2alkZm%2FqrCMoKaapF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
