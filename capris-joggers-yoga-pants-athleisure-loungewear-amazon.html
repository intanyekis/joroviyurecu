Everything old is new again! Walk down the street or scroll through Instagram, and you’ll be hard-pressed not to see Y2K fashion right before your eyes. We never thought we’d see the day when low-rise jeans and printed baby tees came back into style, yet here we are. There are some trends we’re happy to leave in the early 2000s — bubble dresses and skinny scarves can stay in the past, thank you very much."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Walk down the street or scroll through Instagram, and you’ll be hard-pressed not to see <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Y2K fashion</a> right before your eyes. We never thought we’d see the day when low-rise jeans and printed baby tees came back into style, yet here we are. There are some trends we’re happy to leave in the early 2000s — bubble dresses and skinny scarves can stay in the past, thank you very much. But we’re totally fine embracing certain vintage vibes, like Ugg boots and cozy tracksuits. Another <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">retro look that is making a comeback</a>? Capris.</p><p>Halfway between pants and shorts, capris are the ideal length for temperate climates. And since it was just the “perfect date” according to Miss Congeniality, capris are perfect for this time of year — “it’s not too hot, not too cold. All you need is a light jacket!” We just found the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cutest capris from Amazon</a> that are both flattering and functional. Whether you’re lounging around the house or lunging at the gym, you’ll never want to take these comfy joggers off!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/black-capri-joggers.jpg><p><strong>Get the </strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>THANTH Women</strong><strong>’</strong><strong>s Capri Jersey Joggers </strong></a><strong>for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$22</a> at Amazon!

Sometimes we’re just not in the mood for longer layers, especially in the summer — warm weather puts the sweat in sweatpants. Capris are a fashionable fix that give you extra coverage without too much added fabric. Made from a buttery soft Spandex blend, these high-waisted joggers are lightweight, stretchy and breathable. Far less constricting than leggings. Our dream design! Plus, each pair of pants comes with two front pockets and one back pockets for storage on the go.</p><p>Athleisure is the new everyday essential, replacing jeans and a tee. And you can’t wear denim to a workout, so these capris are truly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">multi-purpose pants</a>. The cropped cut hits right below your knees, elongating your legs with a slimming silhouette. Featuring an elastic waistband with a drawstring and a split straight leg, these capris are super chic for loungewear. And they’re available in nine staple colors, sizes S-XXL.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/burgundy-capri-joggers.jpg><p><strong>Get the </strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>THANTH Women</strong><strong>’</strong><strong>s Capri Jersey Joggers </strong></a><strong>for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$22 </a>at Amazon!
