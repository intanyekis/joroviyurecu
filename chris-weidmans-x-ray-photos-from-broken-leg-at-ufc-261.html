“The primary concern is the bone punctured through my calf and skin when I put my weight on it, making sure the laceration doesn’t get infected,” he wrote in part alongside the photos."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

My fibula was broken as well. I guess when they put the tibia back together, my leg was straight [and] the fibula kind of matched back up to where it was broken, and they feel like that can heal on its own as long as I’m not putting weight on it and stuff,” the Long Island native explained.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>Weidman also shared details about a potential timeline in his recovery.</p><p>“Pretty brutal, but I’m going to get through this. I think it’s going to be eight weeks until I can walk without crutches, drive and all that. As far as training, they said between six-to-12 months I’ll be good to go,” he said.</p><p>Weidman added that he’s “trying to find the blessing in disguise and the silver lining” in his situation.</p><p>“As soon as it happened I hit the floor and saw that it happened and the pain started hitting me. I tried to put my mind on something positive and something good that can come out of this,” he said, adding, “I can’t believe this happened.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3J7j21ma29fmLWztdJmrp6hlKKur7%2BMsWSrmalivam706iqZp6ipLpurtGoop6mXaGyqHnArWSunpNif3d9jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
