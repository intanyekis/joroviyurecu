So, we see him go through the changes from a young high school kid, going through the puberty changes and just through the manhood changes and then now becoming his own. He’s definitely owning a lot more of what he’s become,” he said. “So, just with Brooklyn being involved and just with everything in Marvel’s New York, it kind of makes him his own, just through the ruggedness, the fast-paced moving, just the villains. Everybody that’s in Marvel’s New York sums up Miles’ behavior as he’s growing into this equal to Peter.”</p><p>Through Miles, we’re introduced to this new character briefly during the end credits scene. So who is Cindy Moon?

Their neighbor Hailey arrives and Rio insists that she look over Miles’ essay in his room. They go over to his room and share a kiss, but are interrupted by a knock on the door. Rio’s boyfriend Albert Moon introduces himself and his daughter Cindy, who waves back at them, and the scene cuts to black.</p><p>If you’re not familiar with Cindy Moon, she was introduced in 2014 in The Amazing Spider-Man #1 where she was bitten by the same spider as Peter Parker. She has the same abilities as Peter, except for the fact that she has organic webbing when Peter has to make his own web shooters. She goes by the name Silk and is imperative to the Great Web, the thing that connects all Spider-beings in the comics. Since we only see the back of her head for a split second in the end-credits scene, it’s not known how big of a role she will have for future Spider-Man installments. But with the pattern that the developers have, she might be the third Spider-person for the third one, and adding another Spidey to the mix is a win for any fan.</p><p>Our mission at StyleCaster is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
