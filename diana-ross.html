She started her tremendous singing career as the lead singer of the Motown group <strong>The Supremes</strong>, with hit singles such as “You Can’t Hurry Love,” “The Happening,” and more. In May 1970, Diana made her solo debut with an album titled&nbsp;Diana Ross, which featured two of her most top-charting hits “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” and “Reach Out And Touch [Somebody’s Hand].” She then released two follow-up albums,&nbsp;<i>Everything Is Everything</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Surrender.&nbsp;</i>In April 1974, following her solo success, Diana became the first African American woman to co-host the Academy Awards. In 1980, Diana released her most successful album to date, titled&nbsp;Diana, which included her hits&nbsp;“I’m Coming Out” and “Upside Down.” While her solo career was thriving, Diana also dove into acting in 1971, starring in&nbsp;Lady Sings The Blues loosely based on&nbsp;<strong>Billie Holiday</strong>. She was nominated for both a Golden Globe and an Oscar for her performance, with the soundtrack also becoming just as successful. Her second film&nbsp;Mahogany&nbsp;was also a great film and featured Diana’s own costume designs. She also starred in&nbsp;the movie version of&nbsp;The Wiz. Diana released consecutive albums in 1984 and 1985, which did moderately well, but her following four albums throughout the ’90s were not best sellers. In 2002, after a stint in jail for a DUI, Diana returned to live touring and performing. In 2006, she released her first album in seven years called&nbsp;I Love You.&nbsp;In 2014 Ross went on her&nbsp;&nbsp;first headlining tour in three years titled the&nbsp;<i>More Today Than Yesterday: The Greatest Hits Tour</i>, which she dedicated to her late friend&nbsp;<strong>Michael Jackson</strong>. In&nbsp;February 2012, Ross received her first ever&nbsp;Grammy Award for&nbsp;Lifetime Achievement. To this day, she is recognized for her success and tremendous talent, as well as her paving the way for women everywhere.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Diana Ross is best known for being a music industry and pop culture trailblazer.
