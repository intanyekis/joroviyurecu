First, he portrays an innocent American tourist named Frank who is charmed by Jolie’s Elise. Later on, however, it would also seem that Frank is also Elise’s longtime mystery lover, Alexander Pearce, who had been trying to evade authorities throughout the entire movie.Onscreen, the pair had flirty chemistry, which got many wondering if this was all just a camera act or if there was more to the story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-jolie-and-johnny-depp-first-met-right-before-the-tourist>Angelina Jolie And Johnny Depp First Met Right Before The Tourist</h2><p>While some may have assumed that Depp and Jolie first met on set, this wasn’t the case. As it turns out, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they already knew each other by then</a>, sort of.</p><p>“We met, oddly, right before we did this, which was just weird because we have a lot of mutual friends, acquaintances, and people we've worked with,” Depp revealed. “When we sat down together, it was kind of instant. We got each other. Within minutes we were yakking about our kids, the perils of parenthood, and all that fun stuff.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As it turns out too, The Tourist came to Jolie just as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actress and Pitt were doing their best to juggle their schedules</a> between family and films. “We take turns working,” Jolie explained in an interview back in 2010. “One of us is always at home with the kids—always.” It also just so happened that the actress had a brief window to shoot something before Pitt got back to work.</p><p>“I was looking for a very short thing to do before Brad started filming [Moneyball],” Jolie revealed. “And I said I needed something that shoots not too long, in a nice location for my family. Somebody said there’s a script that’s been around, and it shoots in Venice and Paris.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Angelina Jolie Secretly Warned Johnny Depp About Marrying Amber Heard</a></span></p><p>Things certainly worked out for Jolie and Pitt at that time. Jolie also enjoyed working on the film with Depp.</p><p>“He's just such a nice guy. He's so funny and so fun to hang out with,” the actress even said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Plus, he's such a brilliant actor. He's often thought of so much for his deep character work, but it really comes from an artist who is willing to try things. He's not just somebody who's doing these fun [movies]; he's a real experimental deeply-feeling artist, who gives a lot and is very gracious on set to everybody and to his fellow actors.”</p><p>Jolie even revealed that at one point, she and Depp “could not stop laughing” for “a good 15-20 minutes.” “We wasted a lot of film.”</p><h2 id=did-angelina-jolie-and-johnny-depp-ever-date>Did Angelina Jolie And Johnny Depp Ever Date?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering that Jolie already had kids with Pitt by the time she met Depp, it would seem unlikely that the two stars would date. Depp even praised the way his co-star handled all the attention that their famous family got.</p><p>“I have a lot of respect for her. In the face of all that she, Brad, and the kids have to deal with, being globally under the microscope every second of the day, she's grounded,” Depp said. “She's as cool, normal, and low key [a woman] as you'd want to meet.”</p><p>That said, the former co-stars’ relationship was, once again, questioned once <a href=#>Depp’s legal war with ex-wife Amber Heard</a> got underway. In the court filings obtained by Vulture and The Hollywood Reporter, it was revealed that Heard’s legal team asked Depp to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">turn over “all responsive communications” with his “romantic partners.”</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An email from Heard’s lawyers also defined romantic partners as people who were sexually involved with Depp in the past ten years. Moreover, the women who were named as partners included Marion Cotillard, Keira Knightley, and Angelina Jolie.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Close Are Angelina Jolie And Johnny Depp Today?</a></span></p><p>That said, it is also worth noting that none of these actresses have ever commented on dating Depp. Moreover, Jolie also once hinted that her relationship with Depp was strictly platonic, even once saying, “He's just that friend you're so happy to come to work and do scenes with.”</p><p><a href=#>Amber is apparently also a fan of Angelina</a>, despite what Angelina might have said about her in the past.</p><p>Hence, it is possible that Heard’s team was only making allegations in the court filing. At the same time, Depp’s relationships with his former co-stars weren’t even explored further during the court proceedings. This suggests that Heard’s team didn’t find anything there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, as <a href=#>Depp continues to stage his comeback</a>, some may be wondering if there’s a chance for the actor to ever reunite with Jolie onscreen again. It certainly seems like Depp would be open to it. “Boy, I certainly would like to think so. I hope so. If she'll have me again, I'd be more than happy,” the actor once said. “She's impressive. She's a force."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdlruoscuipZplmqS5qrGMo6ahpp6ueqWxz6lkmpukqq6tuNhmm5qslWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
