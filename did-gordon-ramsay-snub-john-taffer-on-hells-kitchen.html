Ramsay was made to be on camera, and with his impressive culinary background, he was able to focus on food and entertainment, which led him down the rabbit hole of fame and fortune.</p><p>Chef Ramsay's TV career has featured countless hits, shockingly-high paychecks, and a number of infamous reality TV moments that are seared in people's minds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to this success, however, he thought TV would ruin his career, so he gave it his all.</p><p>"Everything I was learning in the industry after opening my first business I was putting into these restaurants. And, of course, you know, I was desperate for them to succeed and that was the first thing that sort of hit me -- the devastation if it didn't work, I felt that I was the one that they were going to blame so I gave it my all," he said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview</a>.</p><p>Thankfully, everything paid off in a profound way, and Gordon Ramsay eventually became one of the most famous men on the planet, who also happens to boast a $220 million net worth.</p><p>There are two major names in this story, with the other being TV's John Taffer.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Gordon Ramsay Actually Eat The Airplane Food When He Travels?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jon-taffer-is-a-popular-name-in-his-own-right>Jon Taffer Is A Popular Name In His Own Right</h2><p>If you've watched enough reality TV, then you've likely seen Jon Taffer on your TV screen. The man has been a major success on television, and he's had one heck of a TV career.</p><p>While a success in the world of business beforehand, Taffer became a major name when he starred on Bar Rescue, which debuted back in 2011. It featured the former Troubadour manager going around and helping turn struggling bars around, not unlike Gordon Ramsay's work on Kitchen Nightmares. Taffer was a natural fit on camera, and in no time at all, Bar Rescue became a must-watch show for many.</p><p>The success of the show opened many doors for Taffer, who would host fresh shows, and make appearances on others, all while building his name and his massive net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that the stage has been set, let's take a look at the situation and see what fans were chatting about.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Family Tragedy Devastated Gordon Ramsay, His Wife, And Their Kids</a></span></p><h2 id=john-taffer-didn-39-t-get-much-of-an-introduction-on-hell-rsquo-s-kitchen>John Taffer Didn't Get Much Of An Introduction On Hell’s Kitchen</h2><p>1 year ago, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> thread came to life talking about an episode of Hell's Kitchen that had aired. Episodes are always discussed, but this particular thread was all about John Taffer appearing on the show.</p><p>So, why was Taffer's appearance discussion-worthy? Well, much to the shock of viewers, Taffer didn't even receive an introduction on the show, and was merely treated like a blip on the radar.</p><p>In the thread, one user shared their surprise with the situation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"My jaw dropped too! The Bar Rescue mastermind meets the Kitchen Nightmare genius. How did they not ham this up even a little," they wrote.</p><p>Another user talked about Taffer's lack of time on screen.</p><p>"I was shocked he had only 5 seconds of screen time," they wrote.</p><p>Normally, a show will go out of its way to highlight a major name being on set, but Hell's Kitchen chose to forego this with Taffer's appearance.</p><p>While this might have been odd to some, Taffer's post about the episode sure made it seem like it was no big deal.</p><p>"Did you see me on Hell's Kitchen where I joined the @CCNevadaKMA charity table? It was great to catch up with @GordonRamsay and see one of my @BarRescue kitchen experts,@chefjasonsantos," Taffer wrote.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Does Gordon Ramsay And MasterChef Do With All The Extra Food From The Pantry?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen might not have done Jon Taffer any favors with screen time, but Taffer clearly enjoyed his time on set that day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdnLyzsM6nZKuZnaiuunnSp6ybZZqkta9505qdn52iYryveceeo6WrXaC2ta%2FHnqVo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
