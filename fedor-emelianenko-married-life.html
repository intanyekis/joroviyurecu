They shared their company for seven long years and decided to part ways in 2006. They share a daughter, <strong>Masha</strong> <strong>Emelianenko</strong>.</p><p>With his high-school gone, the fighter added a new girl to his romantic timeline.

Two years later in July, the lovebirds were blessed with another kid, a lovely daughter named <strong>Elizaveta Emelianenko</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Fedor-and-jackson.jpg><p>Fedor and his second wife stayed together for four lovely years and sadly got divorced in 2014. The reasons for their crumbling marriage are not known to this day and both the partners refrain from disclosing the matter with the public.</p><p>“What goes around comes around”. Such became the case for Fedor’s first marriage. As surprising as it may sound, the MMA fighter remarried his first wife Oksana in 2014. They exchanged their vows in the Russian Orthodox Church located at Stary Oskol. To date, they are still together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_much_Does_the_Fighter_Earn></span>How much Does the Fighter Earn?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fedor Emelianenko boasts a total net worth of <strong>$18</strong> <strong>million</strong>.
