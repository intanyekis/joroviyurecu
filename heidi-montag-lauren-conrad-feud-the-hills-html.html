The duo started the series as best friends, but their relationship faltered as the show progressed, bringing in real-life beef and even orchestrated fights for the audience.
The primary reason for their fallout was Montag's relationship with newcomer Spencer Pratt. Conrad disapproved of the relationship, but Montag followed her heart, causing more rift in their friendship.  
As a result, Conrad exited from the series in the middle of its 5th season in 2009."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Conrad&nbsp;disapproved of the relationship, but Montag followed her heart, causing more rift in their friendship.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As a result, Conrad exited from the series in the middle of its 5th season in 2009. As for Montag, she starred on the show in all its six seasons, from 2006 to 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, after a decade,&nbsp;Montag walked down memory lane as she recalled her estranged relationship with Conrad.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>How Heidi Montag and Lauren Conrad's Friendship Ended</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Montag appeared in an interview for Alex Cooper's&nbsp;Call Her Daddy podcast on August 11, 2021, and recounted what went downhill in her relationship with Conrad.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She started by thanking Conrad for bringing her to the show and expressed regret over how their friendship turned south.</p><p>The television star remembered Conrad was once in love with&nbsp;a man she detested. But for the sake of their friendship and her happiness, Montag&nbsp;had supported the duo.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, when she fell in love with Pratt, Conrad bluntly rejected their union, let alone support her.&nbsp;So much so, the reality star made an ultimatum, "Well, if you date Spencer, you're out of&nbsp;the show."&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Montag was admittedly disappointed by such a response and recalled how she was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">treated like a dog</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>How dare you, and I’m not your dog. Yeah, I appreciate you getting me on this show, but that doesn’t mean you own me and you can tell me what to do in my life. I just don’t appreciate that.</p><p>She couldn't appreciate her friend's disapproval and continued her relationship with Pratt.&nbsp;</p><h2>Heidi Montag's Regret</h2><p>The bold move fractured her relationship with Conrad&nbsp;forever. But despite the&nbsp;feud, Montag disclosed she still has "such a love" for her former best friend and stressed how their rapport didn't have to go that way. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She chose and wanted it to go that way, and then kept following up with that, and then kept blaming things on me.</p><p>The 34-year-old also talked about&nbsp;Conrad's success over the years. Confessing that her former co-star didn't make it big, Montag remarked that Conrad could be a billionaire like <a href=# rel=follow>Kylie Jenner</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She recalled how good she was at makeup and stated that she should have done the tutorials. The Colorado native even mentioned how Conrad would be more successful than her Kohl's line.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>She is not where she should have been at all. She has a Kohl’s line — great, whatever. But she should be a hundred-millionaire</p><p>Though Montag's friendship with Conrad crumbled down, her relationship with Pratt is going strong. Since tying the knot in 2008, they welcomed their first child, son Gunner Stone, on October 1,&nbsp;2017.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The pair also returned to the show's sequel, The Hills: New Beginnings, in 2019. The show is currently in its second season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKCVnrGqecyopa2Zl2K5osHRnqVmm5%2Bjv6KwjJ%2BcrpxdqbWmeceio6WrXp3Brrg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
