As Robert Pattinson's girlfriend, Suki is arguably just as famous as her beau. As proof of it, the paparazzi can't get enough of Pattinson and Waterhouse kissing and want to know more about their relationship and all its secrets. After Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson remains a little more guarded, though, refusing to discuss if he is or isn't dating someone. Here is everything about Robert Pattinson's relationship with Suki Waterhouse.</p><h2 id=the-mystery-of-how-robert-pattinson-and-suki-waterhouse-met>The Mystery Of How Robert Pattinson And Suki Waterhouse Met</h2><p>Being around the celebrity scene, Robert and Suki have known each other for several years, even sharing a few mutual friends. <a href=#>But it was in 2018 when they were first spotted cozying up together</a>. The two enjoyed a showing of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again in Notting Hill before walking across the street for celebratory drinks at Soho House. It must have been a perfect date because they also shared a passionate kiss in the streets of London.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Robert Pattinson's Net Worth Changed After 'Twilight'</a></span></p><p>Naturally, this got tongues wagging as fans wondered if Robert and Suki were now officially an item. A source confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People magazine</a> that it was true, saying, "They are very loved-up. They haven't been together that long. But everything seems on the fast track. They are always laughing and smiling at each other." Since then, they've been seen in public numerous times. Suki even attended the actor's birthday party, and the pair showered each other with a lot of PDA when together. They also seem to share a mutual love for coffee since people usually spot them with a fresh cup in hand. The exact date when they started dating remains a mystery. Most fans presume it was in the summer of 2018, but it could have been even earlier than that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-robert-pattinson-and-suki-waterhouse-still-together-and-are-they-ready-to-commit>Are Robert Pattinson And Suki Waterhouse Still Together And Are They Ready To Commit?</h2><p>In Hollywood, it's hard to know if something is serious or merely casual. When it comes to Robert and Suki, the extent of their relationship is a bit of a mystery due to several factors. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grazia</a>, Suki said she enjoys the nomadic lifestyle of being an actor. The model revealed, "I like the escape of that, and I like being away for long periods of time. It's a really good job for someone who doesn't need stability whatsoever." Does this extend to her relationship with Robert? Could it be that they're far more casual than what fans expected? Suki has also been holidaying with her friends over the years, with Pattinson nowhere in sight. However, he could have been busy with a film, which could explain his absence from all the sun and fun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Zoe Kravitz Rocks Daring Cut-Out Dress With Robert Pattinson At The Batman Premiere</a></span></p><p>On the flip side, the two have also been photographed spending a lot of time together, so it isn't like there are huge gaps between when they see each other. Perhaps Robert and Suki understand how important and busy their respective careers are, and they work around their schedules. Considering they've been seeing each other for over three years now, it's more than likely that things are extremely serious.</p><h2 id=robert-pattinson-and-suki-waterhouse-39-s-dating-history>Robert Pattinson And Suki Waterhouse's Dating History</h2><p>After Twilight, Robert Pattinson became a heartthrob to millions of teenagers across the world. The actor wasn't short of suitors. However, his most famous relationship was with Bella Swan herself: Kristen Stewart. From mid-2009, the two were one of the hottest couples in the world. Fans were bewitched and over the moon, seeing how the lovers on screen became a real-life item.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans wondered if they were about to tie the knot as Edward and Bella did in Twilight. Things looked peachy until about mid-2012 when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristen was photographed kissing director Rupert Sanders, who was married at the time</a>. Kristen issued a public apology for the affair, but her relationship with Robert was truly over. They reconciled for a short time afterward, but things didn't work out. Since then, the actor became extremely private and reserved about his personal relationships, choosing to keep his love life out of the public sphere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Model turned actress Suki Waterhouse also had her fair share of high-profile relationships. From 2011 to 2013, she dated Miles Kane, the lead singer of the indie group Last Shadow Puppets. Miles described Suki as the love of his life and even claims his 2013 album Don't Forget Who You Are was inspired by her. Unfortunately, their relationship fizzled out, and she moved on to actor Bradley Cooper, attending red carpet events and jetting around the world with him. The 17-year age gap might have become a problem because the pair also parted after two years together. Leaving behind their past relationships, Robert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse seem like a match made in heaven, and they look happier than ever.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How FKA Twigs Really Feels About Ex-Boyfriend Robert Pattinson Today</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbaledGomZ6qpGK9osDToqWsp55iuqax02afoqtdnLazuMWroJ6mlGLAtrfIZq6arJWntbDB0p5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
