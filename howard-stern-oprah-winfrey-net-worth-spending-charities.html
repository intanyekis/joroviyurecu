While there's no doubt that Howard and Oprah are both two of the most successful people in show business, they are incredibly different. Without a doubt, <a href=#>these differences have affected their relationship</a>. Which is basically non-existent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While many piled on Howard for his comments, the truth is, both he and Oprah actually "show off" their insane fortunes in incredibly positive ways. Forget their lavish lifestyles, these two titans of the entertainment industry are exceedingly generous.</p><h2 id=what-is-howard-stern-39-s-net-worth>What Is Howard Stern's Net Worth?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Howard Stern is worth a whopping $650 million. Given his highly publicized contract renewals with SiriusXM, this number makes sense. Not only has Howard been one of the most successful radio personalities in history, but he's a best-selling author, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was one of the top-earning judges on America's Got Talent</a>, and was the star and producer of the incredibly successful film, Private Parts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Howard Stern Show, which has been on the radio in some form for over 40 years, gets $100 million per year to operate. This is according to a Page Six report that revealed that SiriusXM signed a 5-year contract with Stern for $500 million. Of course, that huge amount accounts for operating costs, staff salaries, marketing, and, of course, Howard's salary.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bruce Springsteen Forgave Howard Stern Before Their Bombshell Interview, Here's Why</a></span></p><p>While we don't know the specifics of Howard's salary, we can assume that it's a lot. And given that this man came from a lower-middle-class family, it's pretty incredible he was able to build such a fortune.</p><h2 id=what-is-oprah-winfrey-39-s-net-worth>What Is Oprah Winfrey's Net Worth?</h2><p>Forbes has Oprah Winfrey worth a whopping $2.5 billion, making her one of the most successful women in the world. The very name "Oprah" has become synonymous with success. And that's saying a lot since she came from nothing. Oprah is a self-made billionaire due to her incredible success in business and entertainment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Capitalism.com, Oprah first started raking in the dough in the early 1980s when her morning chat show, "AM Chicago", evolved into The Oprah Winfrey Show. And no one needs to be told how successful that series became.</p><p>Aside from The Oprah Winfrey Show, the Mississippi-born star founded her own multimedia production company, started O, created her own magazine, network, book club, and became the spokeswoman for numerous brands. On top of this, Oprah has starred in numerous successful films and TV series, as well as started her own podcast. She's also clearly made some rather smart investments, such as with True Food Kitchen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=howard-stern-is-obsessed-with-how-oprah-winfrey-spends-her-net-worth>Howard Stern Is Obsessed With How Oprah Winfrey Spends Her Net Worth</h2><p>Howard Stern is the first person to admit that he's "obsessed" with Oprah. He's said as much on his SiriusXM radio show. Any regular listener knows that Howard has spoken about Oprah more than a few times. Despite Howard's tempering his acid tongue over the years, he has never failed to be honest about his thoughts regarding Oprah's lavish lifestyle.</p><p>This, of course, is what caused so much news in November 2022, and what turned Oprah's legions of fans against him.</p><p>But this was far from the only time Howard has made a comment about how Oprah spends her net worth. <a href=#>He's also criticized her interviewing skills</a> and shared less-than-public stories about how she really behaves behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Howard Stern Really Thought About The Royal Interview With Oprah</a></span></p><p>On his show, Howard has said that his wife, Beth, and longtime co-host, Robin Quivers, have both made fun of him for constantly creeping Oprah's Instagram. He loves to see what she's up to and is blown away by how she flaunts her money. While some of Oprah's fans claim that how she spends her money is none of Howard's business, others agree with the former shock jock who bemoaned Oprah's "lack of self-awareness" while so many of her fans are "struggling" financially.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I make a good living, and I'm having trouble watching Oprah. I go, wow. Look what's going on over there? Her estate is unbelievable," Howard Stern said to co-host Robin Quivers. "When she goes shopping, she goes shopping in her backyard cause everything is growing back there. There's a farm back there ... Oprah's not embarrassed by her wealth at all."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is What Oprah Winfrey Spends Her $3.5 Billion Net Worth On</a></span></p><p>He continued by saying, "It's f***ing mind-blowing when you follow her on Instagram... She kind of likes to show it off, which is something I'm not comfortable with. I don't think that people should show off their wealth."</p><h2 id=which-charities-do-howard-stern-and-oprah-winfrey-support>Which Charities Do Howard Stern And Oprah Winfrey Support?</h2><p>According to The Daily Mail, some of Oprah's fans quickly took to Twitter to go after Howard Stern for his comments about how she spends her money. Among some of the critiques were comments about how philanthropic Oprah is. Some even claimed that Howard hasn't done nearly as much for the world as Oprah has.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But the reality is, both Howard and Oprah are incredibly philanthropic. They just support different charities.</p><p>Like most of Oprah's fans, Howard is more than aware of Oprah's good deeds. During his November 28, 2022 rant about how she flaunts her money, Howard even said as much. He even spent a little time pumping up her school in South Africa, The Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think they believe Oprah's God because let me tell you, she provides, she gives them an education. She gives them meals, don't ask," Howard said. "They love her. And it, it's impressive. I gotta be honest."</p><p>According to Charity.LoveToKnow.com, Oprah supports (or has supported) Habitat for Humanity, The US Dream Academy, the Boys and Girls Club of America, and The Angel Network. Then, of course, she has her very own Foundation which makes investments and donations in numerous endeavors that benefit a lot of people.</p><p>As for Howard Stern, every one of his fans know that he is one of the leading animal activists in the entertainment business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Through the Northshore Animal League and Bianca's Fury Friends, he and his wife, Beth, have found homes for thousands of dogs and cats across America. They also foster cats directly out of their own home. Howard and Beth usually have upwards of 10 foster cats occupying their own personal space at a time.</p><p>According to LookToTheStars.org, Howard has also given money to Steven Tyler's Janie's Fund, which supports dissected women, as well as to Gabrielle's Angel Foundation, a cancer research charity.</p><p>So, while both Howard Stern and Oprah Winfrey have a ton of money and live lives most of us can only dream of, it's clear they both do their part to try and make the world a better place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK%2BRp7Fuv9Oeqadln6W%2ForSMsKCnnqKaxm66xK1ksKeiqbVuv8%2BepZ2hnpx6pLTAq6CtoZWofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
