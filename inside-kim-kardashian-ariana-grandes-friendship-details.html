The duo connected earlier that month after <a href=#>the reality star made her SNL hosting debut</a>.</p><p>The “Break Free” songstress, for her part, got engaged to Davidson in June 2018 after a whirlwind romance. The twosome called it quits four months later.</p><p>“Just because Kim is now dating Ariana’s ex Pete, it hasn’t changed their friendship,” the source adds. “They adore each other and support each other’s brands.”</p><p>Earlier this month, Grande made headlines when <a href=#>she sent Kardashian a press package</a> for her new r.e.m. beauty launches.

The couple <a href=#>tied the knot in May 2021</a> at a private ceremony held at her home in Montecito, California.</p><p>Grande’s wedded bliss is one reason she has “no ill will” for her ex’s romance with Kim, the insider tells Us. “Ariana has completely moved on from Pete,” the source adds. “What they had was in the past. If anything, Ariana would be cheering on Pete and Kim’s relationship since she ultimately wants Kim to find happiness too.”</p><p>The KKW Beauty mogul and the comedian <a href=#>made their romance Instagram official</a> on March 11, with a series of photos shared via Kim’s account. The pictures were snapped during the couple’s pre-Valentine’s Day date in February.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Inside-Kim-Kardashian-and-Ariana-Grandes-Friendship-1.jpg><p>“Kim and Pete are very much excited about what the future holds for them as a couple,” an insider told Us last month. “She adores Pete [and] they’re spending as much time together as they can.”</p><p>The California native filed for divorce from ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a> in February 2021.
