The model, 37, offered “no comment” when asked about her relationship with the retired New England Patriot, 46, during her Elle magazine profile, which was published on Wednesday, November 8.
“I share my work stuff because I decided to keep my personal life personal,” Shayk explained. “That’s why it’s called personal, because it’s something that belongs to me."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Brady was later spotted picking up Shayk from her L.A. hotel, further fueling romance rumors.</p><p>A source told Us Weekly that same month that things between <a href=#>Shayk and Brady were “very new,”</a> but they had “hung out” multiple times.</p><p>“Right now, Tom’s main priorities are focusing on his [three] kids and just having fun,” the insider added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Irina-Shayk-Dodges-Question-About-Tom-Brady-Relationship-3.jpg><p>Brady shares two kids — <a href=#>Benjamin, 13, and daughter Vivian, 10</a> — with his ex-wife, <a href=#><strong>Gisele Bündchen</strong></a>. Per the source, <a href=#>Bündchen was “totally unbothered”</a> by Brady’s romance with Shayk. (Brady and ex-girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Bridget Moynahan</strong></a> also share 15-year-old son Jack.)</p><p>“[She’s] happy because he’s moved on because she has too,” a separate source told Us in July. “She knew he would be dating at some point and really isn’t concerned one way or another.”</p><p>Shayk previously dated <a href=#><strong>Bradley Cooper</strong></a> from 2015 to 2019, and they welcomed daughter <a href=#>Lea De Seine</a> in 2017. While Shayk was linked to Brady, made waves for a vacation with Cooper, 48, sharing topless photos of herself and a shirtless snap of Cooper from the trip.</p><p>A third source told Us at the time that<a href=#> Brady had “no idea”</a> where Shayk and Cooper stood.</p><p>“It’s really none of his business,” the insider shared. “Tom and Irina aren’t in a committed relationship, so she’s free to see anybody she likes.”</p><p>Things between Shaky and Brady the duo came to an end late last month.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Tom and Irina have split, <a href=#>things between them fizzled out</a> and they went their separate ways,” a source confirmed to Us in October. “There’s no ill will towards each other.”</p><p>Two years before Wednesday’s Elle cover, Shayk was more candid about her personal life, <a href=#>speaking to the magazine about Lea and Cooper</a>.</p><p>“I never understood the term coparenting,” she explained to Elle in March 2021. “When I’m with my daughter, I’m 100 percent a mother, and when she’s with her dad, he’s 100 percent her dad. Coparenting is parenting.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaiqpmjrm6%2Fx5qwpGWYlsBuus5mmqilnZq7tXnAm6aurF2lsrO%2FzqeYpWWkpLpurtGam7Jlopq5osDIqKWsoJmlfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
