DeGrom presently plays for the Texas Rangers in Major League Baseball, where he signed a five-year, $185 million contract on December 2, 2022.</p><p>It made him the Rangers’ highest-paid player, surpassing Corey Seager, Marcus Siemen, and Max Scherzer. The Rangers won the 2023 World Series. However, Jacob was unable to participate since he had Tommy John surgery in June of that year. In the ninth round of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft, the New York Mets picked the four-time All-Star. He spent four years in the minors before making his big league debut on May 15, 2014.</p><h2><span id=Jacob_deGroms_Religion_Is_He_Christian_or_Jewish>Jacob deGrom’s Religion: Is He Christian or Jewish?</span></h2><p class=toc_title>Page Contents</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Jacob deGrom’s Religion: Is He Christian or Jewish?</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> What Is Jacob Degrom’s Ethnicity?</a></li></ul><p>Unlike other religious sportsmen who are upfront about their views, the two-time Cy Young Award winner has yet to express his faith publicly. According to reports, Jacob deGrom is a Christian. However, he has not been photographed wearing cross necklaces or having “cross” tattoos, which are traditional ways for Christian athletes to demonstrate their faith.</p><p>However, there is one early hint that deGrom attended Calvary Christian Academy, a private Christian institution in Florida. He was selected District 9’s Class 1A player of the year. On November 8, 2014, the Rangers star married Stacey deGrom (née Harris) in a Christian ceremony at the Delamater House.</p><p>They currently have two children, Jaxon and Aniston. Furthermore, his wife’s Facebook post included a photo of Psalm 37:4, which reads, “Delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart.” Jacob does not utilize social media, so visibility into his personal life is limited. DeGrom, most likely outside of the public eye, also professes his faith in God.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_Jacob_Degroms_Ethnicity>What Is Jacob Degrom’s Ethnicity?</span></h2><p>The American-born baseball pitcher has English, German, and Irish ancestry, as well as a touch of Flemish. Jacob’s parents and grandfather were also residents of the United States, making him the third generation of the deGrom family to live there.</p><p>The Stetson University graduate was born in Florida on June 19, 1988, to Tony deGrom, a former AT&T lineman, and Tammy deGrom, a customer service representative. The deGrom household also included Jacob’s sisters, Jessica and Sarah. The surname ‘deGrom’ has historical ties to both Britain and Belgium.</p><p>According to rumors, the MLB player’s paternal grandfather, Hubert Adolph deGrom, had ties to Belgium. Hubert was the son of Sidney Louis C. De Grom, whose father, Pierre Joseph De Grom (Jacob’s great-great-grandfather), was a Belgian of Flemish heritage.</p><p>His great-grandmother, Martha Witschtowfki, was German. Mary, the baseball player’s maternal grandmother, and her father, Norris (his great-grandfather), were both born in Florida and of German heritage. Jacob’s great-grandmother, Mary, had Irish ancestry.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
