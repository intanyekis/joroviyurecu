There was no caption accompanying the pic, which prominently featured Jonas‚Äô wedding ring on his left hand.</p><p>Fans quickly supported the subtle move in the comments section. ‚ÄúDivorce rumors silenced with one photo üòÖ,‚Äù one social media user wrote, while another praised Jonas for ‚Äúsquashing‚Äù speculation about his romance with Turner, 27. Other fans questioned why Turner wasn‚Äôt in the snap if he was trying to make a statement.</p><p>The upload came one day after Jonas was <a href=#>spotted wearing his ring on stage</a> during a concert in Austin, Texas, after ditching the band for several other shows. On Sunday, September 3, he performed with brothers <a href=#><strong>Nick Jonas</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kevin Jonas</strong></a> at the Moody Center and sang the Happiness Begins ballad ‚ÄúHesitate‚Äù ‚Äî which was inspired by Turner.</p><p>Multiple outlets reported over the weekend that Joe and Turner, who share two daughters, have been in contact with divorce lawyers. Us Weekly reached out to both parties‚Äô reps for comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Joe-Jonas-Blatantly-Displays-Wedding-Ring-Again-as-Questions-Continue-About-Sophie-Turner-Marriage-2.jpg><p>Neither Joe nor Turner have directly addressed the speculation, which was fueled further as fans noticed the pair sold their Miami mansion in August. Turner has also made few appearances at The Tour apart from opening night in New York City last month. (<a href=#><strong>Priyanka Chopra Jonas</strong></a> and<a href=#><strong> Danielle Jonas</strong></a> have been consistently supporting their respective husbands throughout the U.S. run of shows.)</p><p>Turner was first linked to Joe in 2016, and the musician popped the question one year later. They exchanged vows in a <a href=#>surprise Las Vegas wedding</a> in May 2019 after the Billboard Music Awards. One month later, they <a href=#>held a more formal ceremony</a> in France.</p><p>The twosome have <a href=#>remained relatively private</a> about their relationship over the years and have adamantly kept their children out of the spotlight. A source exclusively told Us in October 2022 that Joe and Turner were ‚Äú<a href=#>doing the best they can</a>‚Äù as new parents of two.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Turner and Joe have been raising their girls in the U.S., but the Game of Thrones alum previously expressed a desire to return across the pond. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm slowly <a href=#>dragging my husband back</a> [to England],‚Äù she teased to Elle UK in May 2022. ‚ÄúI really love living in America but, for my mental health, I have to be around my friends and my family.‚Äù</p><p>She added: ‚ÄúI miss England so much. The people, the attitude, everything. England would ideally be the final destination, but [Joe] might take quite a bit of convincing!‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5Vit7C6wKxkrJ2emcBuucSsqpqflWLEqsDHZqmippdirq61w2aqqKiYnrJuv8%2BloK1lo6WypMHLmquip55k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
