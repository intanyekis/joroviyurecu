I’m saving my moves for marriage&nbsp;😂🕺🏽,” the 26-year-old <a href=#>wrote</a> via Instagram on May 18 when his role on the show was announced.</p><p>Marriage is definitely&nbsp;possible for Justin&nbsp;— or <a href=#>one of his 29 fellow contestants</a>. Ahead of the show’s June 7 premiere, Katie, 30, told Us Weekly exclusively that she’s <a href=#>more than ready to walk down the aisle</a>.</p><p>“I just know where I’m at in life, and it really shows how serious I am about falling in love and finding my person,” she said. “And if the thought of being engaged scares you, then you’re not ready to be with me.”</p><p>According to his&nbsp;<a href=#>ABC contestant bio</a>, Justin has never been one to settle — but only because he hasn’t found The One, AKA “someone who is equally beautiful on the inside and out, trustworthy and committed to the idea of teamwork in a relationship.”</p><p>The Maryland native describes his perfect match as someone who’s “passionate about fitness, but also loves to enjoy a day barbecuing and a good bottle of Sauvignon Blanc.”</p><p>While Katie more often appears to <a href=#>toast with a glass of bubbly</a> according to her Instagram, grape choice won’t make or break the potential couple.</p><p>The Washington native was announced as the next Bachelorette in March after she was sent packing during <a href=#><strong>Matt James</strong></a>’ season of <a href=#>The Bachelor</a>. The bank manager — who was introduced to the world when she exited the limo with a sparkling dildo in hand — soon became a fan favorite.</p><p>One month after her role was announced, Matt, 29, said he <a href=#>thinks his ex will be&nbsp;the&nbsp;“‘best to ever do it”</a> when it comes to leading the show.</p><p>“She’s incredible. She’s going to do so well, and I’m excited for her to have this space to find her person,” the Wake Forest&nbsp;University&nbsp;alum told&nbsp;E! News&nbsp;on April 28.</p><p>While Matt let Katie go, one of the Bachelorette’s new beaus is sure to be smarter.</p><p>“Justin considers himself to be very romantic and holds a lot of value in having a strong intimate connection, both emotionally and physically,” the businessman’s bio reads. “This journey is all about finding his forever, so here’s hoping he can find that meaningful connection with Katie.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Along with <a href=#><strong>Blake Moynes</strong></a> and<strong><a href=#> Greg Grippo</a></strong>, Justin is one of the finalists in the running for Katie’s heart.</p><p>Scroll to learn six things about Justin:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BfwrTAyKdkoKSRr7JugYytn6Kml6h6tbuMpKWor12Wr7DB02aroZ1dl66ktMSlpqudpKmybq%2FOp6ueq6SWu7V7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
