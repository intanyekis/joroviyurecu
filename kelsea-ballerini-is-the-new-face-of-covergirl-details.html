Being a @covergirl has been on my bucket list since I was a little girl. They’ve always felt approachable to me through every age, phase of life, or occasion,” she captioned a video of herself playing guitar. “From playing with makeup in middle school to<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>getting ready for some of the biggest stages I’ve been lucky enough to perform on, it’s a full circle moment and so happy<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>to officially join the CG family.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Ballerini’s fans were quick to congratulate the star, with many calling out that she’s the perfect face for the brand. “Ummmm!

It’s not so much how I look, it’s about how I feel. When I moved that value over to where it should be, it really helped me in my healing process.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6Cyrb%2FEmmSbmZyhsrO1zaJkoqtdqbWmec2ermaekZiybrvFZpqorpWntKq%2By2abnqyRnrm0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
