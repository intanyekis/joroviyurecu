This was because she had taken a year off to battle mental health and anxiety issues. She had suffered from depression and her parents had encouraged her to take as much time as needed to complete her courses. In a YouTube video, she had discussed that phase in her life with her subscribers and had encouraged her followers to discuss their issues with near and dear ones. She had also emphasized the importance of developing a strong support structure of family and friends that could help people overcome their mental health issues.</li><li>In August 2018, she had suffered a near-death experience after overdosing on some medication. In an Instagram post 2 years later, she had explained how she had a near-heart-failure due to a seizure caused by the aforementioned overdose. She revealed that she was in a constant battle with herself, unable to decide whether she wanted to live or take her own life. This had led to her suffering from a mild version of split-personality disorder.</li><li>As her situation worsened, she felt that she was being a burden on her family and had decided one particular day that she would consume 2 bottles of pills from her medication. She then felt a sharp pain in her chest and was rushed to a nearby hospital by her family. Upon survival and after receiving strong support from her friends, she took an oath that she would dedicate her life to help as many people as possible who were suffering from similar issues.</li><p>Featured Image by Kristina Maione / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqSpoquknruiecyaoKimlWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
