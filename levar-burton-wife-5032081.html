Nearly three years after that tweet, LeVar and Stephanie’s marriage is going strong.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“She’s hysterical,” LeVar said in a 2013 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Serial Optimist</a> when describing his wife. “She’s got a wicked sense of humor, also, very morbid. Stephanie is a goddess. Fiercely intelligent, stunning to look at. INTENSE in her energy. She’s a goddess. I married a goddess.” So, who is this “goddess” that has given LeVar a reason to get out of bed and reach for the stars? Let’s find out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/LeVar-Burtons-Wife-shutter-embed-3.jpg><h2>Who Is LeVar Burton’s Wife?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>LeVar Burton (b. Feb. 16, 1957) is married to Stephanie Cozard Burton (b. Nov. 10, 1953), a makeup artist with an extensive resume. According to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDB</a>, Stephanie – a Fort Wayne, Indiana native – started her career working in the makeup department for Silver Spoons in 1985. From there, she worked on other ’80s sitcoms like The Facts of Life, Out of this World, and Amen. She also worked on films like White Men Can’t Jump, Ghost Dad, and more. In the 1990s, she worked on True Colors, Living Single, In Living Color, Hangin’ With Mr. Cooper, and Reading Rainbow. She recently worked as a makeup artist on Whose Line Is It Anyway, the US adaptation of the UK show that ran from 2013 to 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>According to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a>, since 2020, she has been the Department Head of Makeup for The Upshaws at Netflix.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Don’t forget – Star Trek PICARD launches today!

The two met on 1988’s Roots: The Gift,” a TV movie that <strong>Louis Gossett</strong> and I did reprising the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>roles</a> of Kunta and Fiddler,” he said in that interview with SO. The Gift is the third installment of the Roots miniseries, following Roots: The Next Generations, which aired in 1979 (two years after the original Roots.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The details about their courtship are few, but clearly, it was love at first sight.</p><h2>When Did Levar & Stephanie Get Married?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>As LeVar indicated in his 2019 tweet, he and Stephanie were married on Oct. 3, 1992. Three decades later, the couple remains passionately in love. When LeVar celebrated his 66th birthday in 2023, she tweeted a photo of them together. “HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the best friend, partner, goofy buddy, and hubby! I love you so much – look what SEXTY SIX looks like.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the best friend, partner, goofy buddy and hubby!

The child was born out of wedlock, and Levar learned of Eian’s existence three years after the boy’s birth. In 1983, LeVar asked the Los Angeles Superior Court to grant him joint legal custody and visitation rights, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Washington Post.</a> “I grew up in a broken home, raised by my mother,” he explained. “I would like for (my son) to have the benefits of both parents.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>But, in 2013, the landscape had changed. Both his and Stephanie’s kids were grown and out of the house. “You know what… we’re empty nesters, so we are in the process of rediscovering who we are to one another,” he told SO. “I’m really trying to remember the romance. It’s an opportunity to really start courting my wife again, and in an effort to really connect on a level we haven’t been able to in a long, long time, just through the nature of life and raising a child. Raising a child in this modern era isn’t easy. Everybody struggles with parenting these days, everybody. It requires a lot of focus if you’re going to do it right.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8uerZqqXZfCs8DOp2SwoZaaenZ8kmtncWlf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
