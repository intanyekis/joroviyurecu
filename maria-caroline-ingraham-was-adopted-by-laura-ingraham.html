Caroline, on the other hand, was three years old when her adoptive mother Laura accepted her from the foster care.</p><p>On her radio show, the conservative talk show presenter announced the adoption of a small girl from Guatemala. While picking up her baby, she described her trip as “the most amazing few days that I’ve ever spent in my life and the best thing I’ve ever done.”</p><p>Laura went on to say to her radio audience,</p><p>“That door opened, and my life was forever changed.”</p><p>In fact, the TV personality had been attempting to adopt Maria for some years. Laura spent several years with her friends’ children before having her own child to prepare herself as a mother and to form a deep bond with children.</p><p>After the adoption was finalized, Ingraham traveled to the foster home and was greeted warmly by all of the children in the orphanage, including Maria. Caroline, the little girl, was standing by the door at the time, holding a single plastic bag.</p><p>Maria also has an adoptive uncle named Curtis Ingraham.</p><h2><span id=Is_there_any_information_on_Maria8217s_biological_parents>Is there any information on Maria’s biological parents?</span></h2><p>However, information about her biological father and mother is still being withheld. Maria was born in Guatemala in the mid-2000s, so little is known about her early life. However, following her adoption, she spent the majority of her youth in the United States. It is also where she attends school. She also has American citizenship and is of mixed heritage.</p><p>Maria lived in an orphanage with eleven other children before her adoption.</p><h2><span id=Maria_has_two_more_adopted_siblings>Maria has two more adopted siblings.</span></h2><p>Caroline was raised alongside her two adoptive siblings. Her mother Laura adopted her younger brother Michael Dmitri from Russia when he was 13 months old in mid-2009.</p><p>Two years later, the most-listened-to woman on political talk radio wedded her third child, a son from Moscow named Dimitri.</p><p>In a July 2011 appearance with Today, Ingraham discussed defending the culture wars as a new parent.</p><p>“My friends thought I was mad. I have adopted three children under the age of six in the last three years. I went from being a carefree social butterfly to a working parent who regularly fried. When you become a new parent, the culture bombards you with advice and pressure to perform (for you and your children).”</p><p>Prefers to remain out of the limelight</p><p>Maria prefers a life away from the spotlight. She makes little public appearances. One of the few times she was spotted with her mother was in December 2019, when they were observed listening to President Donald J. Trump speak at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in West Palm Beach.</p><p>Furthermore, the young girl is not active on any social media networks.</p><h2><span id=Maria_Caroline_Ingraham8217s_address>Maria Caroline Ingraham’s address</span></h2><p>Ingraham presently lives with her mother in McLean, Virginia, along with her two other siblings. Speaking of her lifestyle, which is kept private, the young girl surely has a beautiful way of life.<br>Her monetary worth</p><p>Unfortunately, Maria’s net worth is currently being calculated. However, when it comes to her mother’s riches, Laura has an estimated worth of $40 million as of 2023. Her yearly compensation is $15 million.</p><h2><span id=Laura_Ingraham_Maria8217s_mother_is_she_married_What_about_her_romantic_life>Laura Ingraham, Maria’s mother, is she married? What about her romantic life?</span></h2><p>Laura is a single mother of three adoptive children who has never married but has been in a few relationships in the past. Keith Olbermann was her prior boyfriend. There were also reports that the TV personality was formerly romantically involved with political writer and director Dinesh D’Souza.</p><p>In addition, in April 2005, Ingraham hired Chicago businessman James V. Reyes. The ex-lovers met on a blind date, but their romance didn’t last long. Laura is currently unmarried and does not appear to have any plans to marry anytime soon.</p><p>Laura was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent cancer treatment in 2005, in addition to her personal life.</p><h2><span id=The_Most_Commonly_Asked_Questions_About_Maria_Caroline_Ingraham>The Most Commonly Asked Questions About Maria Caroline Ingraham</span></h2><p>Apart from the material given above, there is a lot of interest in other aspects of Maria’s life.
