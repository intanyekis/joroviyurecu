The Yodeling Prince Mason Ramsey is back. The 12-year-old viral sensation returned this week with a new song called “Twang,” along with a music video. The so-called “motion picture,” according to his Instagram, features Ramsey using his cowboy charms in school to woo a girl twice his height. He sings about how she loves him for his “twang” and “reminds her of a little Hank.” He stands on top of tables with his fashionable boots and finds a rose to give her before he’s quickly dragged away (by just his tiny arm) into the principal’s office."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Now, he’s headlining his own (sold out) tour called How’s Your Girl & How’s Your Family? and has an EP. He also supported Florida Georgia Line during their 2018 tour and was named among Billboard’s <a href=#>“21 Under 21”</a> class of 2018, if you want to feel old and unaccomplished in comparison. He’s been to <a href=#>Coachella</a> and the Grand Ole Opry (thanks to <a href=#>Ellen</a>), and released <a href=#>Christmas music</a> you can add to your holiday playlist alongside Mariah Carey. The tiny reincarnation of Hank Williams will embark on part two of his headlining tour starting in October in Atlanta.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=nymag.com/intelligencer/_pages/cjfk1mo8g002wr5y69n19r0uy@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Walmart Yodeler Is Here to Improve Your Shopping Experience</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjgs4yr3q00jgrryerbcq9y8q@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Viral Success of the Yodeling Kid Seems Awfully Familiar</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>‘Yodeling Kid’ Mason Ramsey Is Back With ‘Twang’ in New Song</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlocmdga3yurdKopWaqkaLApsWMra6appdiura%2FyJxkr6GUmrxvtNOmow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
