He is also known for portraying Ben Grimm/The Thing in the “Fantastic Four” (2005). Michael is the winner of an Emmy Award, Golden Globe and other awards, and is also known as a director and producer. He has been active in the entertainment industry since 1989.</p><p>How rich is the actor? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the overall size of Michael Chiklis’ net worth is as much as $25 million, as of the data presented in late 2017. Acting is the main source of Michael Chiklis’ wealth.</p><h3>Michael Chiklis Net Worth $25 Million</h3><p>To begin with, he was raised in Andover, Massachusetts by his parents Katherine and Charlie Chiklis. He matriculated from Andover High School, and later graduated with a Bachelor’s degree from Boston University College of Fine Arts.</p><p>Chiklis began his acting career with the role of <a href=#>John Belushi</a> in the film “Wired” in 1989 – the film flopped, though Chiklis got rave reviews. Then he played episodic roles in series such as “Miami Vice” (1989), “LA Law” (1990), “Murphy Brown” (1990) and “Seinfeld” (1991). Chiklis’ first major successful role was that of Anthony “Tony” J. Scali in the police series “The Commish” (1991 – 1996), certainly boosting his net worth.</p><p>Then, Michael again had less successful roles, but after which he improved his image by shaving his head and losing some weight. He then auditioned for “The Shield” (2002 – 2008) with a completely different appearance, and was not only cast in the role of Vic Mackey, he won the Golden Glove Award for the Best Actor, Primetime Emmy Award for the Outstanding Lead Actor, Satellite Award for the Best Actor and Television Critics Association Award for the Individual Achievement, not to count other nominations. Afterwards, he landed the lead role in the series’ “No Ordinary Family” (2010 – 2011) and “Vegas” (2012 – 2013). His net worth was rising steadily.</p><p>Getting back to Chiklis career on the big screen, he was cast in the film “Fantastic Four” (2005), and in the sequel “Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer” (2007). As a fan of the original comic book series from Marvel Comics, Chiklis received rave reviews especially as the film was received enthusiastically by audiences. More recently, he starred in the film “High School” (2012) which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, and took the lead role in the David Armstrong’s film “Pawn” (2013) as well as in the film “When the Game Stands Tall” (2014) by Thomas Carter. Currently, he stars in the series “Gotham” (2015 – present). To conclude, all the aforementioned roles have significantly increased the net worth of Michael Chiklis.</p><p>Aside from acting, Michael Chiklis released his first solo album in 2016, entitled “INFLUENCE”, self written and produced at his own Extravaganza Music Studio. Details of sales are not yet available.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of the actor, Chiklis has been married to Michelle Morán since 1992. They have two daughters, Autumn (born in 1993) and Odessa (1999), of whom Autumn played the role of Cassidy Mackey, the daughter of Chiklis’ character Vic Mackey, in “The Shield”.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=21.71602126044><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Michael Chiklis</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$25 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$125,000 per episode</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 30, 1963</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Lowell, Massachusetts, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 8½" (1.74 m)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Producer, Director</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Andover High School, Boston University College of Fine Arts</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Michelle Morán (m. 1992)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Autumn, Odessa</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Parents</td><td>Katherine and Charlie Chiklis</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Peter Chiklis</td></tr><tr readability=0.25><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/Michael-Chiklis-104897092884829</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34146341463415><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/michaelchiklis</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/michaelchiklis/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004821</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.26666666666667><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/michael-chiklis-mn0000883971</a></td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Awards</td><td>Golden Glove Award for Best Actor (2003), Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor (2002), Satellite Award for Best Actor (2004), Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement (2002)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nominations</td><td>Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance (2003), MTV Movie Awards (2006)</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Movies</td><td>“Fantastic Four” (2005), “Wired” (1989), “Miami Vice” (1989), “LA Law” (1990), “Murphy Brown” (1990), “Seinfeld” (1991),“High School” (2012), “Pawn” (2013)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>TV Shows</td><td>“The Commish” (1991 – 1996), “The Shield” (2002 – 2008), “No Ordinary Family” (2010 – 2011), “Vegas” (2012 – 2013), “Gotham” (2015-)</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Rasping voice</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Bald head and bold blue eyes</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=34.436487481591><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=5><td>1</td><td>The best part of being married is, everything we face in life, we face as a team.
