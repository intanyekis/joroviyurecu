Look at them.”</p><p>She continued: “I literally think we were leaving the Grammys to go to The Cheesecake Factory. Me and Emily, Taylor Swift and Demi Lovato are going to The Cheesecake Factory. These are some classy ladies.”</p><p>Cyrus has been candid about her sexuality in the years since Hannah Montana ended its four-season run on <a href=#>Disney Channel</a> in 2011. She came out as pansexual in 2015, the same year she briefly dated <a href=#><strong>Patrick Schwarzenegger</strong></a> and was spotted kissing model <a href=#><strong>Stella Maxwell</strong></a>.</p><p>“I remember telling [my mom <a href=#><strong>Tish Cyrus</strong></a>] I admire women in a different way. And she asked me what that meant. And I said, ‘I love them. I love them like I love boys,’” she revealed in a June 2015 interview with Paper magazine. “And it was so hard for her to understand. She didn’t want me to be judged and she didn’t want me to go to hell. But she believes in me more than she believes in any god. I just asked for her to accept me. And she has.”</p><p>Three years later, Cyrus <a href=#>tied the knot</a> with <a href=#><strong>Liam Hemsworth</strong></a> in December 2018. “I’m in a hetero relationship, but I still am very sexually attracted to women,” she told Elle magazine of their marriage <a href=#>in July 2019</a>, one month before the couple <a href=#>announced their split</a>. “People become vegetarian for health reasons, but bacon is still f–king good, and I know that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Following the couple’s divorce, Cyrus <a href=#>went on to date</a> <a href=#><strong>Kaitlynn Carter</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Cody Simpson</strong></a> before beginning her relationship with <a href=#><strong>Maxx Morando</strong></a> in late 2021.</p><p>During an August 2020 appearance on the <a href=#>“Call Her Daddy” podcast</a>, Cyrus explained that was “attracted to girls before I was ever attracted to guys,” adding, “When I was 11 years old, I used to think Minnie Mouse was super f—king hot. Which is so good because I ended up on Disney, so my odds went up.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamoZyaxm6v2KusrGWjlsa0edOasKWnomLAuLXFrWSdnZ2eeq271ZqrqGWgnrButdJmp6unn5t6tLTErGSboaOaxbaty2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
