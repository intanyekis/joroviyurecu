There are always fresh things to watch on Netflix, but with offerings like Outer Banks and <a href=#>Ozark</a>, they've proven that they know a good thing when the see it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Orange is the New Black</a> was one of Netflix's earliest hits, and Pablo Schreiber was fantastic on the show.</p><p>Fans want to know what Schreiber has been up to since playing Pornstache, and we have all the details here.</p><h2 id=pablo-schreiber-was-on-39-orange-is-the-new-black-39>Pablo Schreiber Was On 'Orange Is The New Black'</h2><p>Orange is the New was a fantastic show during its best seasons, and while its leads kept people coming back for more, the secondary characters were equally as interesting. This leads us to the man nicknamed Pornstache, who was brilliantly portrayed by the talented Pablo Schreiber.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor had a wealth of experience before landing the infamous role, but things really kicked into high gear while he was playing Pornstache. He was sublime in virtually every single scene that he was in, and his presence was always felt while he was on the show. Despite being an antagonist, fans could not get enough of him.</p><p>When talking about the show and the character, Schreiber highlighted that everything has two sides.</p><p>"It tries to walk that line of living in both worlds, being a meaningful piece of art that talks about the state of women's prison and all those things. And at the same time can be uproariously hilarious and should not be taken incredibly seriously. I say that because you can look at the character of Pornstache in both ways."</p><p>Being on Orange is the New Black was an amazing way for Schreiber to make huge strides with mainstream audiences, and he has been busy since his time on the show, including plenty of work on the big screen.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is The Cast Of ‘Orange Is The New Black’ Up To Today</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-39-s-been-in-movies-like-39-skyscraper-39>He's Been In Movies Like 'Skyscraper'</h2><p>While he is not necessarily known as someone who does a lot of film work, Pablo Schreiber has an impressive list of credits. Even when just looking at his post-Orange work, it's clear that studios like working with him.</p><p>Some of his biggest credits include Den of Thieves, Skyscraper, and First Man. Den of Thieves was an especially interesting project, as it was a film that had been over a decade in the making.</p><p>Schreiber talked about this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview</a>, saying, "Yeah, twelve, or fifteen years something like that. So much so, that I just did a movie with The Rock in Vancouver (Skyscraper) and I went up there and the first thing he said when he saw me was, ‘Hey man, Den Of Thieves, I was supposed to do that movie ten years ago!’ So, you know apparently, it got passed round a lot, but we finally got it made and hopefully people like it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That movie made $80 million, so we'd say that things worked out.</p><p>All of his big-screen work is great, but Schreiber has continued making waves on the small screen, as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Dascha Polanco Has Been Up To Since 'Orange Is The New Black'</a></span></p><h2 id=pablo-schreiber-also-has-lots-of-tv-credits>Pablo Schreiber Also Has Lots Of TV Credits</h2><p>When taking a look at Pablo Schreiber's credits, it becomes quite clear that the man has a knack for excelling on the small screen.</p><p>Schreiber has been in projects like American Gods and Defending Jacob since his stint on Orange is the New Black. Prior to that project, he had done loads of work on other impressive shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, the biggest thing going on right now with Schreiber is the role of Master Chief on the Halo series. This thing was years in the making, and there was a bit of a divide when it was announced that he was playing the iconic video game character.</p><p>Fans had grown accustomed to hearing Steve Downes as the character, and many just assumed that Schreiber would be doing an impression. The actor, however, shut this notion down on social media.</p><p>"I don’t do impressions, I play characters. While everyone knows the Master Chief, this show is an opportunity for all of us to get to know John. Thank you for your kind words. We are all working incredibly hard to bring something to the screen that everyone can get behind," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he posted</a>.</p><p>The show has yet to debut, but there is a ton of buzz surrounding it. Hopefully, it can live up to its lofty expectations.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Lauren Lapkus From 'Orange Is The New Black' Is Doing Now</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pablo Schreiber has been quite busy since playing Pornstache, and if Halo hits, he'll be rolling in the dough on that show.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Has Samira Wiley Been Up To Since 'Orange Is The New Black'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinmpqcpHq0r8ernKKalad6sL7Ap56eZZmoerW0xGalnq9dl7mir4ywn56qlWKus7GMrZ%2BesV2jvLh7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
