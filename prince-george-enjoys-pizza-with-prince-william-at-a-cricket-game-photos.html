William wore a blue blazer with a lighter blue button-down shirt. George, meanwhile, was the spitting image of his dad, donning a navy blazer with a blue and white button-down."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Actor <strong>Stephen Fry</strong> was among the guests making small talk with the future King of England.</p><p>Their latest outing comes amid a busy year with more public outings than usual for Prince George. He fulfilled his duties as one of <a href=#>the Pages of Honor</a> at grandfather <a href=#><strong>King Charles III</strong></a>‘s coronation in May.</p><p>Days later, he joined his parents as well as siblings <a href=#>Princess Charlotte</a>, 8, and <a href=#>Prince Louis</a>, 5, for a public engagement <a href=#>during The Big Help Out.</a> The family visited the 3rd Upton Scout Group in Berkshire, England, and the kids helped with planting and painting. George also learned how to use a power drill and even gave archery a chance during some down time.</p><p>The Wales family made another public appearance <a href=#>at the Trooping of the Colour</a> in June.

The prince<a href=#> explained to London’s The Times</a> last month that he wants to make sure his little ones are eventually involved in his quest to end homelessness in the U.K. — but he has to make sure they can understand the complexities first.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“When I left this morning, one of the things I was thinking was, ‘When is the right time to bring George or Charlotte or Louis to a homeless organisation?’ I think when I can balance it with their schooling, they will definitely be exposed to it,” William said prior to launching his Homewards initiative. “On the school run, we talk about what we see. When we were in London, driving backwards and forwards, we regularly used to see people sitting outside supermarkets and we’d talk about it.”</p><p>He continued: “I’d say to the children, ‘Why are they there? What’s going on?’ I think it’s in all our interests, it’s the right thing to do, to expose the children, at the right stage, in the right dialogue, so they have an understanding. They [will] grow up knowing that actually, do you know what, some of us are very fortunate, some of us need a little bit of a helping hand, some of us need to do a bit more where we can to help others improve their lives.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapqpmjsKZ5xp6mq5%2BVYrKvts6yqmaoma%2FHonnWoquhZaCntq%2BvxGauoqScnq6uecCtZJplk6e2pLfErWSgmZ2aerG0zq2mrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
