“I just can’t bear it, so I don’t,” Barr, 70, told The Los Angeles Times in an interview published on Thursday, February 9. “When they killed my character off, that was a message to me, knowing that I’m mentally ill or have mental health issues, that they did want me to commit suicide.”
She continued: “They killed my character … And all of that was to say thank you for bringing 28 million viewers, which they never had before and will never see again."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Everyone is very kind, and it’s just a very good group of people working together. We all have very similar kind of motives and agendas.

I had always wanted a 10th season of the show to tie up everything, to tell the full story of this family as I wanted to tell it,” the&nbsp;<i>She-Devil&nbsp;</i>actress, who is preparing for her first comedy special <i>Roseanne Barr: Cancel This!&nbsp;</i>in 20 years later this month, told the <i>Los Angeles Times.</i>&nbsp;“I came back after 20 years and was No. 1 again. That’s unprecedented. So I started thinking about all the positives of it, my work and the contribution I made to pop culture and television, its portrayal of a woman and her working-class family. They can’t take that away from me. They’ll probably try.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p4><i>If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or considering suicide, call the<a href=#> 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline</a> at 988.</i></p><p class=p4><i>If you or anyone you know is facing substance abuse issues, call the <a href=#>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s National Helpline</a> at 1-800-662-4357 for free and confidential information 24/7.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmoq5WWu6%2BxjJuYq6pdmK6vwIybnJqqXam8bsPArZqhZaSdsm6vzqelnqqjYq6nwMSrZJ6wmal8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
