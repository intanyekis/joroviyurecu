(ABC)Cameron died in July 2019 due to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>complications from epilepsy</a>. He was just 20 years old. Skai and Cameron grew up together on the Disney Channel show Jessie. Skai revealed why she chose “Ordinary People” as the song to dedicate to Cameron.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I mean, overall, it’s just a great song, but Cameron loved that song,” Skai said. “There’s a little clip of him just like singing the song. When I saw that clip, it was just so amazing to me how I mean… he was such a beautiful singer. He was just kind of like not even being serious. So I was like, I definitely want to use that song and dedicate this song to him because I know he likes John Legend, and I think he would just be amazed by it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/skai-jackson-dwts-cameron-boyce-abc-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Alan, 26, choreographed their dance and revealed how he crafted this special number. “I wanted the main part of the dance to be the emotions surrounding Skai and Cameron, and I feel like the Skai handled the choreography perfectly and was able to turn these steps into a beautiful dance,” Alan told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>. “Without her emotions, it would just be steps. I feel like she really connected to the dance and really gave everything she has. And that’s why it turned out to be so beautiful.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Skai and Alan’s performance earned them the highest score of the season so far: 28 out of 30. <strong>Carrie Ann Inaba</strong> gave Skai and Alan their very first 10. “It feels so crazy,” Skai said about getting the first 10 of the season. “I’m just so excited. I can’t believe that I did get a 10. I wasn’t expecting that. So just to get it was just mind-blowing to me.” Dancing With the Stars season 29 airs Mondays at 8 p.m. on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5xe49vZqyjkZ56q63CpKqopl2Yrq6x0ailZpqfrrCmedOroJutpJp6pa3NnKCnn12strW0jK2fnmWjqa6zv4yipa2doqu2psOO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
