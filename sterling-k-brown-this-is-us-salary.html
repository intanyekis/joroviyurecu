What began as a rollercoaster story in September 2016 will finally come to a conclusion at some point this year, just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as creator Dan Fogelman intended from the beginning</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This Is Us has become an integral part of the lives of not just its fans, but the stars who help to bring its characters to life. Chief among them is Sterling K. Brown, whose character on the show has become one of his most iconic ever.</p><p>Playing Randall Pearson on This Is Us has brought Brown a lot of recognition for his talents, including his Golden Globe and Emmy awards, for Best/Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Black Panther star is estimated to have a net worth of about $10 million</a> today, wealth that he has accumulated over the course of his 20-year-long career. We take a look at just how much his This Is Us salary has contributed to this handsome net worth.</p><h2 id=sterling-k-brown-was-originally-paid-75-000-per-episode-on-39-this-is-us-39>Sterling K. Brown Was Originally Paid $75,000 Per Episode On 'This Is Us'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an online synopsis, This Is Us is described as 'The Pearson family's generational story, [which] unfolds in [an] emotional drama. In moments of love, joy, triumph and heartbreak, revelations emerge from parents - Jack and Rebecca's past, while triplets Kate, Randall and Kevin discover deeper meaning in their present day lives.'</p><p>Fogelman was determined to present diversity in the story he created, a process that began even long before production started. In an industry where the average <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">African-American representation in television writers' rooms stands at a meager 5%</a>, Fogelman pushed for 30%.</p><p>Regina King and George Tillman Jr. were also among those drafted in to direct episodes of the show. Brown's Randall Pearson is the standout, black character on the show, being the adopted brother of twins Kate and Kevin Pearson - portrayed by Chrissy Metz and Justin Hartley respectively.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: '<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is Us' Actor Sterling K. Brown Talks About The Impact Of Black Representation On TV</a></span></p><p>Joining this brilliant ensemble cast are Mandy Moore and Milo Ventimiglia, in the roles of the Pearson family parents. When This Is Us began airing, the two were the best paid on the show, with a salary of $85,000 per episode. Brown came third on this list, at $75,000.</p><h2 id=the-main-cast-members-were-rewarded-with-a-pay-rise-in-season-3>The Main Cast Members Were Rewarded With A Pay Rise In Season 3</h2><p>In those early days, there was a significant difference between Brown's salary and his two TV siblings. Hartley and Metz were earning $40,000 each per episode. Not to say that they were complaining; Metz has since famously revealed that she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">only had 81 cents in her bank when she booked the role of Kate on This Is Us</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From the very onset, the show became a massive hit with fans. Having resonated so strongly with audiences across the nation - and the world, This Is Us earned ten Primetime Emmy Award nominations in that first year, as well as three at the Golden Globes.</p><p>The show would pick up where it left off in the second season, as the plaudits continued to pour in for its pacing, and the overall, brilliant cast performances. 'This Is Us continues to tug at heartstrings with an emotional exploration of family that ensures viewers will want to keep the tissues close -- and their loved ones closer,' the critics consensus of Season 2 on Rotten Tomatoes reads.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why It's Been A Great Year For Sterling K. Brown</a></span></p><p>With this kind of success, the main cast members were rewarded with a pay rise starting from Season 3.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brown-and-his-colleagues-are-paid-4-5-million-per-season>Brown And His Colleagues Are Paid $4.5 Million Per Season</h2><p>As the producers recognized the actors' work that was making This Is Us a sensational, global success, they also appeared to acknowledge their equal importance to the show: From the beginning of Season 3, Brown, Moore, Ventimiglia, Hartley and Metz were all elevated to start earning $250,000 per episode.</p><p>With each season of the show having 18 episodes (except Season 5, which had 16), this new salary would translate to $4.5 million per season, albeit before deductions such as tax, as well as agents' and other fees.</p><p>This kind of money has of course played a massive role in helping Brown and his colleagues achieve their current net worths. At the moment, the 45-year-old is the third-richest in the cast of This is Us, with Ventimiglia just $2 million ahead of him at $12 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At $14 million, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Moore is the richest of them all</a>. They will all have a chance to keep growing these incredible amounts of wealth, from future reruns of the show - and whatever new projects they will be taking on. Brown is set to star in an upcoming mini-series titled Washington Black on Hulu.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Tucker Was Only Paid $10,000 For This Role</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrZ2iobavs4ykZJuqn6y7bsDHoqpmoaNiwrR50pqjmqqpZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
