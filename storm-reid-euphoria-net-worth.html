She is constantly working to grow her career, and it's definitely paid off. Her net worth isn't as high as <a href=#>some of her Euphoria cast mates'</a>, but it is more than half a million dollars and will probably be much more than that soon. Let's take a look at how Storm Reid earned her net worth over the years.</p><h2 id=storm-reid-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-around-600-000><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Storm Reid’s Net Worth Is Around $600,000</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of right now, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Storm Reid’s net worth is estimated to be around $600,000</a>. “She makes most of her money from acting in movies and has several endorsements with companies like Mattel! The talented actress is also the face of several brands and earns as a brand ambassador,” according to The Little Facts. Although Storm is one of the richest 18-year-olds in the country, it’s surprising that her net worth isn’t higher considering all of the TV shows and movies she’s starred in.</p><h2 id=she-got-her-big-break-when-she-was-10-years-old><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>She Got Her Big Break When She Was 10 Years Old</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2013, Storm Reid got her big break when she starred in 12 Years a Slave. She played Emily, who is Eliza’s daughter. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eliza is a slave with 2 children—Randall and Emily</a>; we know her as a smart, strong woman (as Solomon Northup describes her), eventually devastated by the loss of her children,” according to Shadow and Act. Storm was only 10 years old and her movie debut became a huge success. The film won three Oscars and was nominated for six more.</p><h2 id=storm-reid-has-starred-in-a-couple-of-nickelodeon-shows><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Storm Reid Has Starred In A Couple Of Nickelodeon Shows</strong></span></h2><p>The same year that Storm played Emily in 12 Years a Slave, she played Avery in the Nickelodeon show, The Thundermans. She only starred in one episode, “This Looks Like a Job For…,” which is about the main characters getting jobs at a pizza parlor. Even though it was only one episode, it helped her receive other acting gigs, including a role on another Nickelodeon show. She acted in Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn a year later and played Scarlett in the episode, “Scaredy Dance,” which is about the Halloween school dance. Around the same time, Storm also made a few appearances in other TV shows, such as NCIS: Los Angeles and Chicago P.D.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lsquo-a-wrinkle-in-time-rsquo-and-lsquo-euphoria-rsquo-made-storm-reid-famous><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>‘A Wrinkle In Time’ And ‘Euphoria’ Made Storm Reid Famous</strong></span></h2><p>After Storm made a few appearances on TV shows, she started starring in more movies, including the one which made her famous: A Wrinkle in Time. According to Good Morning America, the movie is about “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a girl who [is] on a quest to save her father </a>as well as all of space and time, [which is] based on Madeleine L'Engle's classic 1962 book of the same name.” Storm played Meg, who is the main character trying to save her father. Since it’s a Disney movie, it gained a lot of people’s attention, and they got to see how talented Storm Reid truly is. This led her to starring in the popular TV show, Euphoria. She plays Rue’s sister, Gia and the show has made her even more famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why The Filming Of 'Euphoria' Looks Completely Different In Season 2</a></span></p><h2 id=storm-reid-starred-in-two-popular-movies-over-the-past-couple-years><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Storm Reid Starred In Two Popular Movies Over The Past Couple Years</strong></span></h2><p>After the first season of Euphoria, Storm starred in two popular movies, The Invisible Man and the newest version of The Suicide Squad.

The series, like the game, will reportedly focus on Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) as they try and navigate their way out of a quarantine zone set up by a group of survivors known as The Fireflies… Deadline reports that Storm Reid will join the cast as a special guest star and is set to take on the role of Riley Abel.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=storm-reid-might-be-a-millionaire-soon><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Storm Reid Might Be A Millionaire Soon</strong></span></h2><p>Storm Reid has already made more than half a million dollars from all the TV shows and movies she’s been in.
