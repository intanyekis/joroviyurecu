Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴  Line by Line Meaning ↴Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know

Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight

The lyrics start with Del Rey urging her lover to kiss her hard before leaving her. She then admits that she has summertime sadness and that her lover is the best. In the chorus, Del Rey repeats the lyrics "I got that summertime, summertime sadness," which indicates that the sadness is linked to summertime. The second verse opens with Del Rey describing her appearance, which signifies the care she has taken to prepare for a night out. She then reveals that she is feeling electrified and cruising down the coast with her lover. She notes that her lover is her "bad baby" and that she will die happy tonight if she goes.</p><br><p>The chorus is then repeated, with Del Rey saying goodbye to her lover, seemingly forever. She draws an analogy between her emotions and the morning sky. Just like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky, Del Rey declares that she will miss her lover forever. However, Del Rey ultimately promises to keep going through life, driving forward, even after her lover is gone. Ultimately, "Summertime Sadness" is a powerfully emotive track that mixes feelings of melancholy, euphoria, and romanticism, taking the listener on an evocative journey.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Kiss me hard before you go</u><br>I want you to love me passionately before you leave</p><br><p><u>Summertime sadness</u><br>Even though it's summer, I feel sad inside</p><br><p><u>I just wanted you to know</u><br>I want to express my feelings</p><br><p><u>That baby, you're the best</u><br>You are the most amazing person</p><br><p><u>I got my red dress on tonight</u><br>I am dressed in a stunning red dress</p><br><p><u>Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight</u><br>I am dancing in the dark under the moon's light</p><br><p><u>Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style</u><br>I styled my hair like a beauty queen</p><br><p><u>High heels off, I'm feeling alive</u><br>I feel free and alive without my high heels on</p><br><p><u>Oh, my God, I feel it in the air</u><br>I sense something exciting in the atmosphere</p><br><p><u>Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare</u><br>The sound of wires is like a sizzle and a snare drum</p><br><p><u>Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere</u><br>I feel passionate and alive everywhere</p><br><p><u>Nothing scares me anymore (one, two, three, four)</u><br>I am fearless and bold</p><br><p><u>I got that summertime, summertime sadness</u><br>I feel sad even though it's summertime</p><br><p><u>Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness</u><br>A playful repetition of summertime sadness</p><br><p><u>Got that summertime, summertime sadness</u><br>A repeated expression of feeling sad in the summer</p><br><p><u>Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh</u><br>A vocalization to add emphasis to the previous lines</p><br><p><u>I'm feelin' electric tonight</u><br>I am feeling energetic and alive</p><br><p><u>Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99</u><br>I am driving down the coast at high speed</p><br><p><u>Got my bad baby by my heavenly side</u><br>I have my lover who is both sinful and angelic with me</p><br><p><u>I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight</u><br>If I die tonight, I will be content and satisfied</p><br><p><u>Think I'll miss you forever</u><br>I will always miss you</p><br><p><u>Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky</u><br>I will miss you as much as the stars miss the sun when it's gone</p><br><p><u>Later's better than never</u><br>It's better to be late than never</p><br><p><u>Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive, (drive) drive</u><br>Even if you leave me, I will keep going and moving forward</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group, Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC<br>Written by: Rick Nowels, Elizabeth Grant</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maISRo66gkMSlloudqWSgtrnMnqmtoZ2arJStw6ecrKs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
