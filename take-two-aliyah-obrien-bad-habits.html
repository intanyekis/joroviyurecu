O'Brien describes her character, Detective Christine Rollins as a "badass with a strong moral compass."</p><p>"Christine's awesome, a boss and really good at her job," O'Brien added.</p><p>jumpforjoyphotoproject.com</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH TAKE&nbsp;TWO'S ALIYAH O'BRIEN</a></strong></p><p>We also chatted with the actress about what book she had recently read and enjoyed to share with our readers.</p><p>"This could be very boring. Or it could be very helpful," O'Brien laughed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She told us that she is into personal development and self-help books mostly. The last book that she read is in that genre and it's called The Five-Second Rule by Mel Robbins. O'Brien mentioned that at the time of the interview, she was currently in the middle of re-reading it again.</p><p>"It’s about how to shift your bad habits to good habits and how to take action on your instincts," the actress told us. "Usually what happens it we have an instinct to do something and then we talk ourselves out of it because we get scared. We tell ourselves why we shouldn’t do that thing, but this is how to stop yourself before you talk yourself out of something and just do it."</p><p>She went on to describe how the book teaches its readers to not fear taking action and work toward pursuing good habits and eventually, leading that mindset to pursue dreams.</p><p>"It’s such a good book," O'Brien told us. "I highly recommend it. If everyone read this book, I feel like we would all be doing more of what we want to be doing in the world."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Powerful words! The actress said that she recommends getting the audiobook version because the author, Mel Robbins, narrates the book herself. O'Brien let us know that Robbins is a top female public speaking figure in the United States (discussing self-help and motivation), and the audiobook version feels like the author is speaking to you not just reading a manuscript into a microphone.</p><p>pinterest.com</p><p>Personal development and self-help books have been popular for decades but they seem to be on the rise lately.</p><p>Will you read Mel Robbins' book based on Aliyah O'Brien's recommendation? We would be lying if we said we weren't intrigued by it! Taking action to pursuing dreams and changing bad habits into good habits?
