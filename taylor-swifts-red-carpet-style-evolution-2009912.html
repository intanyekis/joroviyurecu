When the Pennsylvania native first emerged onto the scene in 2006 — at only 16 years old — her wardrobe consisted of ruffled sundresses and rustic cowboy boots. She’d often accessorize with jeweled headbands and wore her signature blonde tresses in tight curls.
“When I was 15, I realized I loved the idea of a sundress and cowboy boots and that’s all I wore for like two years, and then, I just started loving the bohemian fairy-type look, with the flower headband, so I dressed like how a fairy would dress for two years,” she said of her early fashion days, per Taste of Country."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In the years that followed, Swift ditched frilly frocks for ones that featured sparkles, cutouts and much shorter hems. She also traded in her Western shoes for over-the-knee boots, strappy sandals, glossy pumps and began rocking a <a href=#>bold red lip</a>.</p><p>At the 2011 Vanity Fair Oscar Party, the “Eyes Open” artist sparkled onto the red carpet in a shimmery gold number by Zuhair Murad. She continued the glittery theme at the 2013 American Music Awards, opting for a metallic mini dress by Julien Macdonald.</p><p>Her most breathtaking bejeweled look is perhaps the sultry Oscar de la Renta ensemble she wore at the <a href=#>2022 MTV Video Music Awards</a>. The dress, which appeared to take inspiration from the flapper era, featured a sheer slip that was covered in layers of crystals that perfectly draped the Grammy winner’s body. The look was as racy as ever as it exposed Swift’s stomach and thigh area.</p><p>Swift donned another “naked” dress months later at the MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2022. For the big night, the “Bad Blood” artist turned heads in a David Koma masterpiece. The dress was designed with a fitted black leotard that was teamed with an emerald-embellished netted skirt.</p><p>In addition to sparkles, Swift has a thing for two-piece sets. At the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, she showed off her abs in a sequined houndstooth crop top and joggers by Ashish. The following year, she mastered the art of color blocking in an orange bralette and a billowing pink skirt by Versace.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When it comes to luxury labels, Swift’s go-to brands include Versace, Balmain and Oscar de la Renta.
