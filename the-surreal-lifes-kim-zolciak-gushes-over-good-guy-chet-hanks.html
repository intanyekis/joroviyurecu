Zolciak, 46, told US Weekly exclusively that she “adores” her castmate and the son of actor Tom Hanks, after the pair were shown getting into bed together in a trailer for the show.
“Kim is a MILF,” Chet says in the trailer as the camera cuts to the bedroom with Zolciak commenting, “That’s gonna look so terrible."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I know nobody believes that with [estranged husband <strong>Kroy Biermann</strong>’s] body, but you could be very attractive and if you’re stupid, I’m not interested.”</p><p>Zolciak said that with Chet, 33, there was an <a href=#>immediate attraction</a></p><p>“Yes, he has a nice body, but it’s just kind of his vibe and what he puts off and his energy,” she said. “He had made me a protein shake right away. I adore him. I’ve gotten to know him throughout The Surreal Life and even more recently and he’s great.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/The-Surreal-Life-Kim-Zolciak-Gushes-Over-Good-Guy-Chet-Hanks-Amid-Hookup-Rumors.jpg><p>She added that she had to ask her 27-year-old daughter, <strong>Brielle Biermann</strong>, who Chet even was.</p><p>“I did not know who he was when I walked into the house,” she admitted. “I stepped outside to FaceTime Brielle and I said, ‘There’s some guy named Chet here’ and she was like, ‘There’s only one Chet’ I’m like, ‘What do you mean?’ She’s like, ‘It’s Chet Hanks.’ Who’s Chet Hanks? She’s like, ‘Mom, Tom Hanks, his son.’”</p><p>Now that they know each other, the feeling is mutual. Us caught up with Chet as well, who gave Zolciak similarly glowing reviews.</p><p>“Kim is just cool as hell,” he said. “She’s funny. She’s got that, like, attitude. I just knew that we would get along right from the jump and we did. Kim was awesome.”</p><p>Outside of the show, The Real Housewives of Atlanta alum and Kroy are in the process of getting divorced. She says in the trailer that Biermann “does not want me here.” Their divorce, which will <a href=#>go to trial in November</a>, comes amid a slew of financial troubles for the couple. They’re currently facing the <a href=#>possibility of foreclosure</a> on their Georgia mansion.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In the meantime, Zolciak and Chet are still in touch.
