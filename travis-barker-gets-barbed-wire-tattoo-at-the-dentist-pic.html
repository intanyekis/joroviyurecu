He later took to Instagram Stories to show a close up image of his spiky barbed wire ink.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3>The musician’s 4.6 million followers quickly took the comments section — and it’s easy to understand why. It’s not everyday you see someone getting tatted at the dentist.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Travis-Barker-Gets-a-Massive-Barbed-Wire-Tattoo-During-His-Dentist-Appointment-4.jpg><p class=p3>“Bruh this guy brought his tattoo artist to the dentist lol that’s a whole new level of Boss,” a user wrote, while another said, “TRAVISSSS THIS IS ICONIC.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3>Others made a point to call out that Barker isn’t the first celeb to pull the tattoo-at-the-dentist trick. <strong>Post Malone</strong> iconically received a shin tattoo from inker <strong>Ganga</strong> while getting a cosmetic procedure with <strong>Thomas Connelly</strong>, DDS.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3>“Did you get this idea from Post Malone? Lol,” a user quipped. Barker quickly responded to the comment. “Never I stay awake for every tattoo just managing my time,” he wrote.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3>While Barker was wide-eyed during the process, his calm, cool and collected nature is pretty impressive as the skin around the knee is notoriously sensitive.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Travis-Barker-Gets-a-Massive-Barbed-Wire-Tattoo-During-His-Dentist-Appointment-3.jpg><p class=p3>That said, the “Born With Horns” drummer is a pro. He has more than 100 tattoos in his collection. Barker has everything from sweet tributes for his children, Alabama and Landon, to a massive boombox across his abs.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3>Barker has also received a handful of tattoos in recent months to honor fiancée <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>. He has everything from an imprint of her lips inked on his arm to a script design of her name tattooed on his chest.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3>The Barker Wellness founder even went so far as to let the 42-year-old Poosh founder ink “I love you” in her handwriting on his arm. The impromptu session went down when the two were still dating in May 2021.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3>“I tattoo,” Kardashian captioned her Instagram post at the time, sharing a series of photos from the at-home inking session. And even though it was the mom of four’s first time giving a tattoo, Barker was seriously impressed.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3>He not only commented “woman of many talents” on her Instagram post, but he also claimed it was the “best tattoo ever” on his Instagram Stories.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6m%2FosLIrGSbmaKgsrN5xp6rrGWSlr%2BjscNmrqKqlWLBosDTqKZmmaRiwamxjJ2cp6yZqMFuvMicZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
