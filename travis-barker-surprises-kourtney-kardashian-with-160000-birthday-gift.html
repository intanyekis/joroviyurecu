The simplistic drawing features a blonde girl in a blue dress and hat. Above her, the words “Love! Something” are written a cloud.</p><p>Travis apparently bought the artwork recently. <a href=#>According to Sotheby’s auction house</a>, the painting sold at an auction on April 5th for $160,000. The piece was previously on display at the Santa Monica Museum of Art in 2000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yoshitomo Nara is a Japanese artist who’s had over 40 solo exhibitions around the world, including in the MoMA and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</p><p>Nara’s work has been on the auction block countless times, and his work has gone for much more than what Travis Barker recently paid, with Nara’s <a href=#>most expensive piece once selling for over $24 million</a>.</p><p>Travis later made an Instagram tribute to Kourtney where he had sweet words to share with his followers. “I'm so grateful that today you were born. You deserve everything your heart desires. Nothing makes me happier than seeing you smile,” the Blink-182 drummer wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"You stole my heart the moment we met," he continued. "Happy birthday to the most beautiful amazing woman to walk the face of the earth. I love you my wife."</p><p>Travis and Kourtney tied the knot last summer in a series of lavish ceremonies. The first had a fake ceremony in Las Vegas, before legally tying the knot in a courthouse ceremony in California in May.</p><p>Later that month, the couple flew to Italy with their loved ones for an even bigger celebration. Fashion house <a href=#>Dolce & Gabbana dressed Travis and Kourtney for the festivities</a> and even invited them to stay in their private estate in Portofino, making for an extra luxurious wedding getaway.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kanye West’s Presidential Campaign Paid Nick Fuentes Over $30,000</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>Sotheby’s</a>, <a href=#>Mutual Art</a>, <a href=#>E!
