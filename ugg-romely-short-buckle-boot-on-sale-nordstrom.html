Despite some sunshine on the forecast, winter is still here. Yes, there’s plenty of time to rock all of your favorite cold-weather wins. Of course, Uggs boots are a quintessential winter fashion staple which offer plenty of versatility. Due to their ability to insulate and keep your feet warm, they have been a mainstay for decades."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Yes, there’s plenty of time to rock all of your favorite cold-weather wins. Of course, <a href=# rel=noopener>Uggs boots</a> are a quintessential winter fashion staple which offer plenty of versatility. Due to their ability to insulate and keep your feet warm, they have been a mainstay for decades. But recently, their popularity has skyrocketed. Uggs sell out all the time, but we found a pair of chic and unique boots from the brand on sale at Nordstrom — <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">and they’re only $100</a>!</p><p>These&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ugg Romely Short Buckle Boots</a> will make a fantastic addition to anyone’s closet. They boast effortlessly cool moto babe-inspired energy — thanks to the strap and buckle across the upper — which will lend itself perfectly to any outfit. These boots feature a water-resistant suede upper and a shearling, soft wool lining for ample coziness. And don’t worry, the Uggplush lining has moisture-wicking properties for a smooth and dry fit.</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ugg Romely Short Buckle Boot</a> for $100 (was $150) at Nordstrom!</strong></p><p><i></i>These Ugg boots are a departure from the brand’s usual offerings, which makes them even more special. To style them, simply slip on your favorite jeans and a supple <a href=# rel=noopener>leather coat</a>. For a more upscale aesthetic, you can rock a seasonally-appropriate maxi skirt and a sweater for a casual winter moment. This specific&nbsp; boot style comes in two colors and has a 5 to 12 size range. I love this pair of boots because they’re so versatile, and they help me make easy outfit selections during cold winter mornings. Who doesn’t want to size a little time in the a.m.?</p><p>Though Ugg has millions of fans singing the brand’s praises around the world, one Nordstrom shopper&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>, “I have been looking for short Uggs, and when I saw these, I was thrilled. I love the buckle. You can still wear pants or leggings, and it looks good. They are roasty toasty. They were a great find.”</p><p>Another satisfied Nordstrom reviewer&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="nofollow noopener">added</a>, “They have become my go-to boots for every outing I go to during cold weather. Warmish (be sure to wear also warm socks!) feet and the waterproof is no joke -I had water, beer and wine dropped on the boots, and everything wiped up easily. Really happy with them. Be sure to buy the size you’d wear with flats, especially if you wear thick socks. They might be tight for a while, but eventually, they give in.”</p><p>Want to upgrade your Ugg game while winter’s still here?
