Neither are the entrepreneurs who did not strike a deal with Pier Paolo Visconti in the tank.</p><p>Visconti isn’t the only one who was turned down for the show. He did not, however, abandon his invention, the Elliptical Stroller. Many people are still interested in clever invention for mothers!</p><p>Here’s an update on the Elliptical Stroller Shark Tank!</p><h2><span id=The_world8217s_only_stroller_Shark_Tank_No_Deal><strong>The world’s only stroller, </strong>Shark Tank: No Deal</span></h2><p>The inventor of the <strong>Elliptical Stroller</strong> claims that his product is the world’s only stroller that also functions as an exercise machine. Pier Paolo Visconti came up with the idea of combining a stroller and an elliptical machine after his sister couldn’t lose her post-pregnancy fat without sacrificing time with her baby.</p><p><strong>Visconti received seven patents for the product, for which he spent $72,000 of his $170,000 investment.</strong></p><p>Although they liked the concept, sharks Kevin O’Leary and Robert Herjavec were put off by the weight of the product after riding in it.</p><p>It was suggested that Visconti sell his idea to the stroller industry’s bigwigs for a big cut. Visconti, on the other hand, was not ready to go that route.</p><p>Visconti was adamant about incorporating one of the sharks into his invention. But they were not all convinced, especially given his $500,000 asking price!</p><p>He also informed the sharks that the <strong>Elliptical Stroller he brought to the show was valued at $48,000!</strong></p><h2><span id=Stroller_Improvements_Following_Tank_Rejection>Stroller Improvements Following Tank Rejection</span></h2><p><strong>Pier Paolo Visconti</strong> works as a real estate agent in Florida for Douglas Elliman. The Italian-born and raised Miami resident has improved his stroller invention, which he said he works on in his spare time.</p><p>The product’s official website lists numerous advantages for mothers and their babies, as well as news of an improvement. Visconti appears to be still working on the prototype and has not yet sold any products.</p><p>However, the website indicates that a new model, The Baby Step, is on the way! Photographs of the new prototype have also been made public.</p><p>In comparison to the original design, the Baby Step appears to be much simpler, smaller, and easier to use. Many people thought the original model was too big and heavy. Visconti, on the other hand, appears to have taken their criticism to heart. The new model can be attached to the majority of popular strollers, which must be a huge benefit to buyers and investors!</p><p>Perhaps if Visconti returns to Shark Tank, the investors will consider his new, smaller, lighter model!</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Atz Lee Kilcher, A Star Of \"Alaska: The Last Frontier,\" Got Married"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":301440,"10":2,"11":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"15":"Arial","18":1,"21":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/atz-lee-kilcher-a-star-of-alaska-the-last-frontier-got-married/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/atz-lee-kilcher-a-star-of-alaska-the-last-frontier-got-married/"}{"1":78}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Atz Lee Kilcher, A Star Of “Alaska: The Last Frontier,” Got Married</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Elliptical Stroller</a> <a href=# rel=tag>shark tank</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>“Dead to Me” Season 3 Is Set To Be Released On Netflix Soon</a></h3>After a nearly two-year hiatus, Dead to Me returns for its third and final season.
