That does not necessarily mean that it gets easier, but that star is pretty used to how things roll at this point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As fans are undoubtedly aware, Johnny Depp has been a major film and television star for decades now. He did good work in the '80s, but once the 1990s rolled around, he turned into a powerhouse at the box office, and this is a trend that continued into the 2000s and beyond.</p><p>Depp has basically seen and done it all in the entertainment industry, and he has even branched out into doing things that are more personally rewarding. For instance, Depp's band, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Vampires</a>, have cranked out some fun tunes, and the band is anchored by other huge stars, including shock rock legend Alice Cooper, and Joe Perry of Aerosmith theme.</p><p>Acting and personal matters will always be what steals the most headlines, and Depp has done this more than a few times since breaking out 35 years ago. The star has received plenty of coverage for numerous things, including his love life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Was Emma Roberts And Evan Peters' Relationship Similar To Amber Heard And Johnny Depp's?</a></span></p><h2 id=johnny-depp-has-some-high-profile-romances>Johnny Depp Has Some High-Profile Romances</h2><p>In the headlines, Johnny Depp has been no stranger to receiving coverage about his biggest relationships. In the past, he has been linked to actresses like Jennifer Grey and Sherilyn Fenn. He also received a massive amount of media attention for his prior engagement to Winona Ryder, who he worked on Edward Scissorhands with.</p><p>Depp has also been in relationships with Kate Moss, and Vanessa Paradis, who he had two children with.</p><p>Depp and Paradis were together from 1998 to 2012, and Paradis has been vocal about her support of Depp during this trying time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, there is no way to dish on Johnny Depp's past relationships without at least mentioning his past marriage to Amber Heard. The pair were only married from 2015 to 2017, but given everything going on in headlines right now, their timeline is quite important.</p><p>Another major relationship of Depp's that has been generating interest is his time spent with actress, Ellen Barkin.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Internet's Most Popular Questions About The Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial, Answered</a></span></p><h2 id=barkin-and-depp-got-close-in-39-fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas-39>Barkin And Depp Got Close In 'Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas'</h2><p>Ellen Barkin's time with Johnny Depp has been making waves lately, and the actress recently opened up about their former romance, even giving details about when things began between them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"According to Barkin, she and Depp became friends in 1990 but ultimately, they got into a relationship, which was more of sexual nature than the romantic one in 1994. She reportedly said their “romance” lasted about 3-5 months and she “never heard from him again,” before also claiming that they “were romantically involved” when they worked together in the 1998 film ‘Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas.’ The film was shot on location in Las Vegas from August 3, 1997, and lasted 56 days," writes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meaww</a>.</p><p>This is pretty typical in Hollywood, as many relationships start on the sets of movies. Even though Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is known for being a chaotic flick, it is interesting to learn that this is when Depp and Barkin began their romantic relationship.</p><p>Another key part of her testimony that got people talking was the fact that she dished on Johnny Depp's jealousy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Barkin said that Depp was "just a jealous man, controlling, where are you going, who are you going with. What did you do last night. I had a scratch on my back once that got him very, very angry because he insisted it came from having sex with a person who wasn't him.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Can't Stop Watching Johnny Depp Hug His Lawyer But Who Is Camille Vasquez?</a></span></p><p>Johnny Depp and Ellen Barkin weren't together for too long, but her recent testimony has piqued the interest of fans.
