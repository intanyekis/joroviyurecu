Trish Stratus went on to define the Attitude Era as far as the girls were concerned. Trish Stratus debuted and looked like plenty of the girls that debuted during this time - just boobs and hair under a cowgirl hat. It wouldn’t take long to see that she was far more than that. With all due respect to Lex Luger, she was the total package.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Trish Stratus Vs. Mickie James IS Still The Best Women's Storyline In WWE History</a></span></p><p>Trish had the body that would not quit (a staple of every era of Women’s wrestling since The Attitude Era) as well as mic skills, and the girl next door smile. She also had no qualms about getting battered and bloody in the ring. The <a href=#>former fitness model arrived as a greenhorn and came out the other end of a six-year career as one of the best to ever had done it</a>. She was inducted into The Hall Of Fame in 2013 and of course, has made several appearances for the WWE since then. But here’s what she really has been doing since leaving it all in the ring.</p><h2 id=jill-of-all-trades>Jill Of All Trades</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Trish-Stratus-Yoga-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from marrying her high school sweetheart (who got hilariously booed out of MSG during Trish’s HOF speech) and starting a family, she also opened and operated her own Yoga studio. Naturally dubbed Stratusphere Yoga, the Canadian cutie had opened up shop in 2008. Her hard work and dedication shined through, and the Studio won Top Choice awards for business in 2009 and 2013. Unfortunately, she shut the business down in 2015. But that wasn’t her only source of income or Stratusfaction. Trish has been able to balance being a wife and mother with being an entrepreneur. Her <a href=#>biggest asset being herself, Trish has also starred in a few movies as well as a Reality show, Armed And Fabulous</a>. While she didn’t seek to become a huge star in the entertainment industry, everything she did do, she was able to excel at.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=post-retirement-wrestling-appearances>Post Retirement Wrestling Appearances</h2><p>Just like practically every other wrestler who retires, Trish Status simply retired from the grind of 300-plus days on the road as a full-time wrestler. During her time away from active duty, the Hall Of Famer had made appearances all over the WWE. She netted a WrestleMania payday when she teamed with John Morrison and Snooki.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Trish Stratus & 9 Other Wrestlers That Improved Tremendously</a></span></p><p>She’s also along with Lita teamed up at the women’s only PPV, Evolution. Appearances on the Bump, a Tough Enough trainer, and convention circuits with Lita as Team Bestie - Trish is never far away from the ring. She last competed in her hometown at SummerSlam 2019 in a losing effort against Charlotte Flair.</p><h2 id=canadian-bombshell>Canadian Bombshell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Trish-Stratus-Canadas-Got-Talent.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like her outfit at WrestleMania 18 from her native Toronto, Trish Stratus proudly represents the Maple Leaf whenever and wherever she can. Instead of seeking Hollywood fame and fortune, she <a href=#>continues to accept jobs in Canada on Canadian TV, which undoubtedly keeps her closer to her Canadian family</a>. In the years since her retirement, but she also took some time to travel the world for Canada’s Travel + Escape channel called (what else?) Stratusphere. She also hosted the 2006 Canadian Hall Of Fame ceremony and made fans drool when she kissed fellow Canadian bombshell, Pamela Anderson. This year she has teamed up with Howie Mandel to be one of the judges of Canada’s Got Talent, which recently ended its second season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are seldom a few superstars more beloved than Trish Stratus, and she knows it too. Luckily not in a cocky way, either. That adoration is certainly reciprocal as well. Trish does all sorts of signings and appearances to give back to the wrestling community. But unlike a lot of ex-wrestlers still sometimes longing for their former glory, Trish Stratus is one-hundred percent satisfied (Satisfied?) living the quieter life as a wife, mother, and occasionally dipping her toe in the entrepreneurial waters.</p><p>However, not just a few days ago, the Maple Leafed Marvel was at home both on Raw and in Toronto. She teased coming out of retirement, but Bayley and the rest of Damage Control interrupted and wouldn't let her get a word in edge-wise. Should she make the big return, fans will undoubtedly see her versus Bayley very soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenna61edOroKygXajBs63TrqpmnJmZeqKy056pZqSVlsOqusZmrrCdXZrFsbjAoqWenF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
