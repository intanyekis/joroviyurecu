It's incredible what Gillan has become today with measuring her success in her personal happiness, which was hard but not impossible for her.</p><p>The Scottish-born actress, Gillan, was <i>18&nbsp;</i>when she found her passion for the arts of acting. Since then, she is pursuing her dreams as an actress as well as a filmmaker. So, how is Gillan's love life going? Is she in a relationship or she is a single lady? Let's take a turnover of Gillan's personal life.</p><h2>Is The Jumanji Actress Dating a New Boyfriend?</h2><p>The&nbsp;<i>33</i>-years-old actress, Karen is reportedly not dating a new boyfriend in&nbsp;2021. She keeps her appearance only in big walls of cinemas and occasionally appears in the eyes of her fans, which makes them curious about what she is going in her intimate life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/26/Photo-1582710090285.jpg><p>Well, if there is any curiosity over Karen's personal life, she is currently busy on her filming works. This year&nbsp;2021, she is going to hit the box office with her three upcoming big movies like&nbsp;<i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Thor: Love and Thunder, </i>etc.</p><p><i><strong>The actress</strong></i> <a href=#><strong>Yael Eitan</strong></a> <i><strong>is also living a single life</strong></i></p><h2>Broke her Long Term Relationship with Patrick Green</h2><p><i>The Party's Just Beginning&nbsp;</i>director, Karen, was previously involved in a romantic affair with a photographer,&nbsp;<strong>Patrick Green,&nbsp;</strong>who is&nbsp;<i>1</i>-year older than her. The duo met for the first time in&nbsp;<i>2006&nbsp;</i>and shortly started dating after having a lovely time.</p><p>The couple then decided to split up after dating for almost six years due to some personal differences in&nbsp;<i>2012</i>. After their separation, Karen's fans asked her whether she had a relationship like David Bailey and Jean Shrimpton in the <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>television film</strong></a>,&nbsp;<i>We'll Take Manhattan</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/26/Photo-1582709740401.jpg><p>When the question hits Karen's relationship with former boyfriend, Patrick, she said that<i> "they never really did any of that, but it's quite healthy to keep certain things separate in a relationship." </i>The two probably broke up in New York, after completing the film,&nbsp;<i>We'll Take Manhattan</i>.</p><h2>Gillan's Rumors of Dating...</h2><p><i>National Award</i>-winning actress Gillan was linked into a secret relationship with a British actor,&nbsp;<strong>Andrew Brooke,</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<i>2012</i>.

Apart from this,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Kim Hyun-Joong</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Jung So-min</strong></a>&nbsp;were also rumored to be dating couples in&nbsp;<i>2010</i>.</p><p><i><strong>If You're Passionate In Reading Celebrities' Intimate Details As Well As Career Highlights, Then Visit&nbsp;</strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>Married Celeb</strong></i></a><i><strong>!!!</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jrCfqGWZqHqsrdGepWafmaG5orrSZpmosZantqa6w2apnqSRqbawutKhoKllo6mutcHS</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
