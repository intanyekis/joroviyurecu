She makes the decision. So, I do think she is a little bit in love with him but in the end the dream prevails, the objective prevails, the goal is what matters."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/instar52096028.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Albie admitted to being "played" by Lucia while reuniting with Portia at the airport, Tabasco believes the former had real feelings for her character. "Maybe he was in love too," she said of Albie.</p><p>"Because sometimes when you're on holiday vacation you just feel your emotions in a heightened way. So, maybe he was in love. When I read the script, I dreamt about Lucia and Albie at the end, maybe in Los Angeles or wherever in the world. But together."</p><p>Speaking to TheWrap, the actress also shared her theory about Lucia's genuine attraction to Albie. "She does say that she has always had this dream of going to the United States [and] going to Los Angeles," she said. "And probably that's another element that she feels attracted to [in] Albie, because he comes from such a different world of hers, which is Taormina."</p><p>Well, we've all had our Lucia or Albie at one point in our youth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60edKipKimkWLBoq7ArJqoZZKas7C%2BxGahqKGenruoedahoK2dXaG8tcHSZqqemaOku25%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
