While the exact cause of her untimely death remains undisclosed, Loop News reported that a CT scan conducted before her passing revealed a substantial black mass. Friends and family gathered to bid a final farewell to Tanella at a heart-wrenching homegoing celebration held on August 28, 2023, at the St. George Parish Church.</p><p>Though she was known for her close relationship with her superstar cousin, Rihanna, Tanella Alleyne carved out her own presence in the world. With around 55,000 followers on Instagram, she shared her unique perspective and keen interest in fashion with her dedicated audience.</p><p>Fondly referred to as TT or Nella by her friends, Tanella was a student at the Graydon Sealy Secondary School. In a solemn tribute on Facebook, the school expressed their grief over the loss of Tanella, along with another former student, Kamal Goodridge:</p><p>“The management and staff of The Graydon Sealy Secondary School are sad to announce the passing of former students Tanella Alleyne & Kamal Goodridge. We extend sincere condolences to their family, friends, and colleagues. May their souls rest in peace.”</p><p></p><p>Tragedy had already struck the Alleyne family when Tanella’s brother, Tavon, lost his life six years ago due to a fatal shooting in the Eden Lodge area of St. Michael’s, Barbados. The identity of the assailant remains unknown. In a poignant moment, Tanella reflected on their tumultuous family history:</p><p>“We lost our mother at seven, and our dad was never playing his part. Then everyone separated, we never lived together until recently. This was our first Christmas together, the first time we’ve ever lived together.”</p><p></p><p>While dealing with these profound losses, Rihanna, Tanella’s famous cousin, embraced motherhood for the second time in August 2023. Together with A$AP Rocky, the couple welcomed their second child on August 3, 2023, following Rihanna’s announcement of her pregnancy during the Super Bowl halftime show in February 2023. Their first child, RZA Athelston Mayers, born in May of the previous year, was named in homage to the iconic leader of the Wu-Tang Clan, RZA, also known as Robert Fitzgerald Diggs.</p><p>Rihanna and A$AP Rocky’s relationship became public in November 2020, and their love blossomed in the spotlight, culminating in their red carpet debut at the 2021 Met Gala.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kxKm7jLCYrGWklrumuMuaZJqknJrGr7GMq6ChmZ6jrrR5wqisrKGeYr%2BmucSmmZ6qlZl6qrqMnqSorJmku6K4jJ%2BYq52nmrmtew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
