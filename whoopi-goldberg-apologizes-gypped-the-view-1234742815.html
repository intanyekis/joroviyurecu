On Wednesday (March 15), Goldberg got into a discussion about Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels, whereas the 67-year-old said, “The people who still believe that he [Trump] got, you know, gypped somehow in the election…”
The word, which is commonly used as a synonym for someone getting cheated or deceived, is also derived from a slur used against the Romani, or Roma, people."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The actress-turned-host stated that the tragic time in history was “not about race.” Ahead of apologizing for her comment, she elaborated even more after receiving backlash. She was then&nbsp;temporarily suspended&nbsp;from the show.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“My best friend said, ‘Not for nothing is there no box on the census for the Jewish race. So that leads me to believe that we’re probably not a race,'” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Sunday Times</a> in December 2022. “The oppressor is telling you what you are. Why are you believing them? They’re Nazis. Why believe what they’re saying?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Later on Goldberg<a href=# rel=nofollow> issued an apology</a> saying, “I’m still learning a lot and believe me, I heard everything everyone said to me. I believe that the Holocaust was about race, and I am still as sorry now as I was then that I upset, hurt and angered people. My sincere apologies again, especially to everyone who thought this was a fresh rehash of the subject. I promise it was not.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She added, “In this time of rising antisemitism, I want to be very clear when I say that I always stood with the Jewish people and always will. My support for them has not wavered and never will.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6y1sLvPomSgp5yZr6a%2BxmaYqaecpLSqxsSsZKCxoKWypXnToZxmrpmaxG59kWxrcGxibX52ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
