But it turns out there is some drama behind the scenes for Bear Brown and his wife Raiven, whether they remain married or not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The details of what happened between Raiven and Bear didn't come out during the show but instead leaked out by way of police reports and social media posts. To date, it seems this is the shadiest storyline that went down on Alaskan Bush People.</p><h2 id=bear-brown-met-raiven-adams-during-alaskan-bush-people>Bear Brown Met Raiven Adams During Alaskan Bush People</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/raiven-adams-alaskan-bush-people.jpg><p>The Alaskan Bush People cast has always had a major spotlight shined on their personal lives, especially when the brothers of the family began dating. For their part, Snowbird and Rainy have seemingly never had a relationship while on the show—or if they have, they've kept it very private.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The brothers, in contrast, have often had publicized relationships, especially as they began dating women who weren't from the Alaskan Bush where they lived at the time. In later seasons, the focus was largely on Noah and Gabe's marriages, though fans suspect that the brothers (including Bear) <a href=#>may have rushed to get married</a> for some unhealthy reasons.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is Why Matt Brown No Longer Appears On Alaskan Bush People</a></span></p><p>There was also some drama when it came out that Joshua "Bam Bam" Brown was dating someone who used to work on Alaskan Bush People. Yet that was some of the tamest drama compared to Bear's issues. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Raiven reportedly accused Bear</a> of being unstable, using illicit substances, and being abusive.</p><p>With everything that happened surrounding Bear's marriage, it's understandable that viewers would question the authenticity of the relationships, but to date, Gabe and Noah seem very happy in their respective marriages (there's even <a href=#>a very simple explanation for why Gabe Brown's wife Raquell never appears</a> on screen).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Raiven, who originally appeared in Alaskan Bush People's content, that seemed to fade as her relationship with Bear became rocky.</p><h2 id=the-couple-moved-to-texas-before-welcoming-their-second-child>The Couple Moved To Texas Before Welcoming Their Second Child</h2><p>Fans following Bear and Raiven's journey will recall that the two met in Washington when Raiven helped photograph Noah's wedding. The two seemed to still live there when their first child, a son named River, was born.</p><p>But seemingly both before and after their son arrived, there was trouble between Raiven and Bear. Almost immediately after announcing the pregnancy, the two split up. Yet after their baby was born, they broke up.</p><p>There were even <a href=#>domestic violence charges against Bear, involving an arrest</a>, for whatever went down during the pair's troubled relationship. After that, the couple got married—in 2022—and a few months later announced they were expecting a second child.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Almost Half Of The Alaskan Bush People Family Has Spent Time In Jail</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that they had to travel many hours for Raiven's doctor's appointments with their second baby, and considering that their first needed a NICU stay, the couple decided to relocate temporarily to Texas. This way, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bear explained on social media</a>, the family could be close to Raiven's family and medical attention.</p><p>Though their second son, Cove, was born nearly full-term, he still needed time in the NICU.</p><h2 id=what-happened-with-bear-brown-and-raiven>What Happened With Bear Brown And Raiven?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bear-brown-on-alaskan-bush-people.jpg><p>As of April 2023, it's assumed that Bear and Raiven Brown have split up yet again. However, the reasoning for that assumption is something of a stretch. Based on a social media post that Raiven made after the couple's second child arrived, everyone has assumed that the pair split up while living in Texas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In one Instagram post, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Raiven reportedly wrote that she was a single mom</a>, saying, "The boys and I moved to wa and I shipped everything with a uhaul box thing... So I've been living out of a bag with a newborn and toddler. Now the shipment that was supposed to arrive today is delayed."</p><p>That part of the caption seemed to allude to the fact that the family had relocated back to Washington after their stay in Texas. The next part of the caption raised eyebrows, however, when Raiven wrote, "Lol my luck I tell you I'm gonna go cry hahah. Taking care of two kids as a single parent is challenging."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Do Any Of The Alaskan Bush People Have Real Jobs?</a></span></p><p>Based on the use of the phrase "single parent," people began to assume that Bear and Raiven had split up yet again. However, Raiven's social media has gone private since that post was shared, meaning only approved followers can see her posts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As far as fans and countless publications assuming Bear and Raiven are now divorced (or on their way to ending their legal marriage), there are a few inconsistencies.</p><p>For one thing, why would Raiven move back to Washington alone if her support system is in Texas? Bear didn't explain which of Raiven's family members lived in Texas, only that she wanted to be closer to them at the end of her pregnancy.</p><p>It would seem that Raiven may have called herself a single parent due to Bear not currently being with her at the time. Since she shipped her and the boys' belongings ahead to Washington, it sounds as if she plans to reunite with Bear at some point. It's possible that they live some distance away from the family ranch at this point, given their children's initial health needs, but that Bear was away with his family when Raiven returned.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, since Raiven's social media went quiet—and Bear hasn't addressed the situation publicly (yet?)—fans can only speculate for now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecGemKtlkqe8uLqMmqWdZaKWtrexzWaYnZmdqHqjvsSaomatoGKura3SpJinZZKqwKl5z56mqaSVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
