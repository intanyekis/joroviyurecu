Fans thought that it would be fun to see former housewives together again, especially on a fun vacation. <a href=#>Fan reaction to Real Housewives All Stars</a>, the original name for this new series, was fairly mixed, with viewers thinking that it would be fun and entertaining if certain people were chosen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now the crossover series is called Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip and while season 1 isn't even available for streaming on Peacock yet, there is already talk about season 2 and what it will be like. A crossover is always going to create buzz, as fans are excited about the <a href=#>Summer House and Southern Charm series</a>. Let's take a look at why fans are upset about season 2 of Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip.</p><h2 id=vicki-gunvalson-39-s-views>Vicki Gunvalson's Views</h2><p><a href=#>RHOC fan reaction to Vicki Gunvalson</a> has not always been positive, and it's interesting to note that Vicki will be given a lot of airtime in season 2 of Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip.</p><p>A fan shared a social media <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">screenshot of Vicki's son Michael</a> talking about the COVID-19 vaccine in a Reddit post. When someone asked how Vicki felt about him getting vaccinated as she has been against it, he replied, "She said 'it broke her heart' lol."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Season 2 of The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip will include Brandi Glanville, Tamra Judge, and Vicki Gunvalson, and Vicki will talk about her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-vaccine opinions</a>, according to Vanity Fair.</p><p>According to the publication, Vicki told her co-stars that it was a bad idea to get the vaccine. Dorinda Medley has been vocal about being all for the vaccine.</p><p>A source told Page Six, “She wouldn’t stop fighting about the shot and really got into it with Dorinda. Vicki told Dorinda that everyone who got the vaccine is going to die."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since people tune into the Real Housewives franchise because they want to see the friendships between the co-stars, the vacations that they go on, and of course, the fights, it does seem odd that this show would focus so much on Vicki's anti-vaccine beliefs.</p><p>The Hollywood Gossip reported that Vicki went on many "rants" that were part of this season.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Inside Vicki Gunvalson’s New House In North Carolina</a></span></p><p>Several fans aren't pleased that Vicki is able to share her thoughts and feelings on this topic on The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip. When someone shared a cast photo in a Reddit thread, a fan said it seemed like "a complete mess" and another fan wrote that it's "irresponsible giving Vicki a platform after the whole cancer scam."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fan was referring to season 10 of The Real Housewives of Orange County when Vicki's boyfriend Brooks Ayers told everyone that he had cancer, but it turned out that he was lying and pretending to have medical records that he didn't have. It does make sense that people would be upset to hear Vicki talking about the virus and any other health-related subjects after that storyline.</p><p>A fan explained the events surrounding the cast photo: "For context: Vicki told her 7 housewives castmates of All-stars 2 that the COVID-19 vaccine will kill them. This occurred at Dorinda’s own home in the Berkshires, our beloved Blue Stone Manor."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another fan responded that they would take Dorinda's side in the Dorinda vs. Vicki debate: "I really need to see this. I’m on Dorindas team on this one, I assume that everyone else is too."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘RHOC’: What Really Happened Between Vicki Gunvalson And Brooks Ayers?</a></span></p><h2 id=season-1-of-39-real-housewives-ultimate-girls-trip-39>Season 1 Of 'Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip'</h2><p>While fans will have to wait and see what season 2 of the crossover series brings, season 1 still has to come out first, and it will star Ramona Singer, Melissa Gorga, Teresa Giudice, Kyle Richards, Kenya Moore, Cynthia Bailey, and Luann de Lesseps.</p><p>According to E! News, Melissa Gorga said of Ramona Singer, ""Ramona is just..she's her own being. She makes me laugh. I personally love her, but she tends to push buttons sometimes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Melissa also said that the show is going to be hilarious: the reality star explained, "It's just a lot of big personalities. Obviously they picked big personalities from all the different cities, all together on yachts, on jets, on planes. It's just crazy, it really is. It's pee your pants funny. It's above and beyond."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘RHOC’: The Truth About Vicki Gunvalson's Multiple Marriages</a></span></p><p>Fans of The Real Housewives of Orange County were curious about what kinds of storylines would be featured on this Real Housewives crossover series, and while fans know that Vicki is often part of dramatic scenes, it definitely sounds season 2 is going to be pretty intense.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Truth About Vicki Gunvalson’s Famous Family Van Scene On 'RHOC'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdm66vv4yaqZ6mpGK1orzPsmSwoaSderW0xGasqZuforavs4yrnJqkXZ28tr%2FEsKCvnaNisLO70qymr52iYsCmvsieqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
