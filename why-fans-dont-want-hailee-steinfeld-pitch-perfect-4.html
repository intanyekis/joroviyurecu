Especially Hailee Steinfeld, who moved on to wider-ranging projects like 'Hawkeye' and 'Spider-Man.' But even if she wanted to do a 'PP4,' fans don't want her to.</p><h2 id=fans-hope-hailee-stays-away-from-a-potential-39-pp4-39>Fans Hope Hailee Stays Away From A Potential 'PP4'</h2><p>As much as fans would love a 'Pitch Perfect 4,' they don't want to see Hailee make a return. The thing is, it's not because they don't like her or think she's a bad actress. Their reasoning stems from viewers' reactions to her character.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Hailee Steinfeld Gets Candid About The Challenges Of Dating In Hollywood</a></span></p><p>Hailee has played Emily Junk in the 'Pitch Perfect' sequels two and three, but her character isn't really a viewer favorite. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one fan explained</a> about their hopes for a Hailee-free 'PP' sequel, "a bunch of entitled fanbrats" came after not just the character, but Hailee herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They noted that "the hate HAILEE (Not even talking the hate Emily Junk gets but her actual actress) got was just absurd." The hate came from fans on social media, but both Hailee and Rebel Wilson agreed that the character of Emily was really only "worth" her "banter" with Amy.</p><h2 id=fans-think-hailee-steinfeld-can-do-better-than-39-emily-39>Fans Think Hailee Steinfeld Can Do Better Than 'Emily'</h2><p>Fans of Haillee (and her character) think that Emily got the short end of the stick, and that the "banter" was really Emily being bullied.</p><p>So while fans hated on the character, supporters of Hailee argued that her part was just a sucky one. And that's why they don't want Steinfeld to return to the franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because what's the good in playing a role she'll continue to be despised for, especially when other opportunities are literally lining up ahead of her?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Hailee Steinfeld Reveals How Important Emily And Sue’s Relationship In ‘Dickinson’ Is</a></span></p><p>Yes, <a href=#>she may have refused to formally train for 'Hawkeye,</a>' but she did put in the work for the role, and fans are thrilled about seeing her kick butt in a role that's vastly different from her previous gigs.</p><p>If a 'Pitch Perfect 4' ever does come to fruition, maybe the producers will just nix Emily altogether, or give her a better character arc than what viewers have seen so far. Hailee definitely deserves it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here's How Much Hailee Steinfeld Is Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdm66vv4ydpqesXayur8CMoZiipJWaerTAxKKln52cmXqxtdOcn2aolaezpq%2FTZmto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
