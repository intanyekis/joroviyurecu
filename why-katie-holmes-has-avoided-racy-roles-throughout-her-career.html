Let's look a little bit past what we're wearing," the <a href=#>Batman Begins alum</a> said of her experience as a woman in Hollywood. "That's our duty amongst each other. I feel like the woman's journey is deeper."</p><p>During the interview, she also revealed that she had avoided racy parts throughout her career because she's "not sexy." Of course, her fans disagree.

"I used to have a friend of mine come to all my photo shoots to make sure that they didn't try to make me that way." When asked about the expectations of being "sexier" after Dawson's Creek, the actress said, "Yeah, I guess I just wanted to be an actor."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar29713805.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of her breakout series, she also shared what it was like joining the cast at 18. "I was just 18 when we started, and I really appreciated the writing because I felt like, as a teenager, I had so many different feelings, trying to go from being a girl to a woman," she said.</p><p>"And I felt like [creator Kevin Williamson] had this way of putting words to those feelings," she continued. "So for me, playing that role, I was like, 'Oh, that's what that means. Oh, I get that.' I loved doing it. It was a really fun, profound experience."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Katie Holmes Oddly Predicted Her Future Relationship With Tom Cruise During Her Time With Chris Klein</a></span></p><h2 id=katie-holmes-on-directing-herself-in-rare-objects>Katie Holmes On Directing Herself In Rare Objects</h2><p>These days, Holmes has also been working behind the scenes. Recently, she directed herself on the 2023 film, Rare Objects. When asked about the experience, the First Daughter star admitted that it was "difficult" to be leading the entire set this time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's difficult in the sense that you’re wearing two hats," she said, "but your most important one on set is the director because you're leading the ship."</p><p>She added: "When I stepped into being an actor, in my head, I was [more] aware of time. I was like, I actually have to get this in very few takes because I know what we have left to get tonight. I don't want to hold people up. I worked with an acting teacher prior to prepping the film. So I had my directions in my head for what I wanted to do."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar51237971.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress teased that she's currently working on two films. "Well, I'm putting together two films right now. One is a smaller one that Alan Cumming and I wrote together, and it'll be the two of us," she spilled. "And then another project that I'll just direct and we're figuring out casting."</p><p>She then noted that it's empowering to be at this point in her career. "I'm always trying to find stories. It's so exciting to have a voice as a woman and put our perspective out there," she said. "You reach a certain age and you're like, 'I think this is interesting.' I finally have the confidence to be like, 'No, I think I’m going to say this. I think I’m going to do this.'"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Katie Holmes Made the Wrong Decision Passing On A Sequel Worth $1 Billion At The Box Office, In Favor Of Mad Money, Which Barely Made Over $26 Million</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katie-holmes-on-being-a-mom-outside-of-work>Katie Holmes On Being A Mom Outside Of Work</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar52612776.jpg><p>Aside from her new directorial passion, Holmes is also grateful to be a parent of a teenage girl. "What has been really important for me with my daughter, because she was so visible at a young age, is I really like to protect her," she said of Suri. "I'm very grateful to be a parent, to be her parent. She's an incredible person."</p><p>Suri has actually been credited for singing in Holmes' two recent films. "Yes. I hope she always does something on my films. I always ask her," the latter said of working with her daughter. "But both of those experiences came out of the same sense of what I love about our industry, which is, you have these projects and you become a family with people."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Holmes also emphasized the importance of doing such collaboration in a "safe, beautiful, creative space." She said that "it comes out of love for me to include someone who I love dearly. That's how I like to work. I like to have that kind of feeling. It was very meaningful to me to have her there, because she's my heart."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdoK61tcRmn6iknZrAbrTArGSarp%2BesaawjKuYnLFdp7ytsdJmq6Gqn6q0qbvUrWShnaJisKK%2BxJ6paA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
