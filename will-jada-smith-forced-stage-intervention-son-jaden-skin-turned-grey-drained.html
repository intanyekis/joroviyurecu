"So he was wasting away. He just looked drained, he was just depleted, he wasn’t getting the nutrients."</p><p>The 50-year-old Hollywood megastar noted his son had "dark circles" under his eyes. "There was even a little greyness to his skin," he added. "We got really nervous. But you’re definitely looking better now."</p><p>Jaden has since moved over to a vegetarian diet from a strictly vegan regime - meaning he still doesn't consume meat but can have dairy among some other animal products.</p><p>"I also just wanna say that I’m vegetarian, that I’ve tried to be vegan. I’m vegetarian, you know, I’ve tried to eat vegan meals," Jaden said. "I’ll go vegan for a week or so but for the past year I’ve been vegetarian."</p><p>According to him, the main reason behind his poor diet was that he often skipped meals when he "didn't get around" to eating. "I was just eating like two meals a day... maybe one," he explained. "Maybe just that one big meal and I’m like, 'Oh, you know, I didn’t get around to it.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5mhuW62wJ2YZqudnsGpecWoqZydlGLAta3GnmSipqSav7exza2gqKZdqLyvecmam56mXai4qrqMrayrppWZeqi%2BxLJknaqRnrumsA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
