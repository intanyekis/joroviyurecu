This effort falls somewhere betwixt the two, starting with the checks on the left shoulder but fading away as it reaches the chest.

This is arguably a better way to do what was discussed in the Iran kits: rather than just having a mirror image as the reserve outfit, you design something new that references the pattern on the home shirt. That’s what Adidas have done here for Japan, with the fuzzy design that dominates the home shirt restricted to a couple of panels on the sleeves of the away.</p><p>That nicely offsets the basic, clean nature of the otherwise plain white shirt with black trim, which could be boring without the flashes of colour. You don’t like to say something is perfect, but…it’s tough to find anything wrong here.

Another piece of this Puma/shield nonsense. The positioning of the Swiss flag makes this one look a bit like a shirt handed out to first aiders at a fun run, but actually compared to the other Puma/shield horrors. This isn’t quite as bad as the others. The thin hoopy pattern behind the shield is a nice reference to the home shirt, and white and red usually tends to look decent whatever the circumstances.
