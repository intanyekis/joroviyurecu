Jey or Solo Sikoa feel more likely to take the Undisputed WWE Universal championship from Reigns than ever before. An outsider like Seth Rollins for Cody Rhodes likely won’t feel as special now.</p><p>While the night ended on quite the note, there were plenty of hits, misses and surprises the rest of the way. WWE went with the safe choice of Damian Priest in the men’s Money in the Bank match and hit a great note with Iyo Sky on the women’s side.</p><p>John Cena and Drew McIntyre both returned, but too much of the in-ring action felt like filler or just a means to an end for a surprise or angle — especially the women’s tag championships.</p><p>Here are five takeaways from Money in the Bank: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>End of an Aura</h2><p>Jey Uso pinning Roman Reigns was the firmest indication of how The Bloodline story could end. The shocking win came after a ref bump kept The Usos from pinning Reigns earlier after a 1D and it appeared The Tribal Chief was going to win two other times. Solo Sikoa delivered a Samoan Spike to Jimmy and he and Reigns hit Jey with a spike-spear combination. Reigns covered a stacked pair of Usos, but they both kicked out.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Jey Uso pins Roman Reigns in the main event of Money in the Bank. <span class=credit>WWE</span></figure><p>Jey Uso used a callback to the early days of The Bloodline with a kick out-low blow to Reigns after a spear. It was a fitting bit of medicine of something Reigns once used all too effectively. With Sikoa subdued on the outside, the move opened the door for some superkicks and Jey Uso hitting a splash from the top rope to keep Reigns’ shoulders to the mat to bring the story nearly full circle.</p><p>While I’m not sure Reigns’ aura of invincibility needed to be taken away from him before losing the championships, it is quite the story beat and put in doubt if someone outside the family will end the historic reigns. Jey Uso is now lined up to be Reigns’ opponent at SummerSlam and it feels like Jey or Solo need to be the ones to dethrone him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The match itself seemed to play around if Sikoa would stay loyal to Reigns and go for the kill on his brothers. He did every step of the way — even snapping the champ out of an emotional breakdown after the stacked kick-out. It felt like a big moment for him and will the loss make him doubt Reigns’ leadership.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Story over Star</h2><p>Sometimes WWE refuses to give fans what they want — no matter how much they express their desires. L.A. Knight was the clear people’s choice to win Money in the Bank and boy did WWE toy with that fact. Near the end, the 40-year-old Knight fought off the majority of the six other competitors and appeared to be in the clear to become Mr. Money in the Bank. That was until Damian Priest came along and sent him crashing down onto another ladder with a Falcon Arrow before claiming the championship contract for himself.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Damian Priest is Mr. Money in the Bank. <span class=credit>WWE</span></figure><p>Priest, who has never been a world champion of a major promotion, was one of the three logical winners coming into the match because of exactly the story WWE is telling between him and fellow member of The Judgment Day, Finn Balor. He cost Balor a shot at winning the World Heavyweight championship by appearing to want to cash in on him. But if you aren’t going to pull the trigger on the mega-over Knight, will the opportunity come again?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>WWE did resist the temptation of having Logan Paul win, but the YouTube sensation continues to leave an impression in every match he’s in. Paul delivered a top-rope frog splash onto an unforgiving ladder propped up between the ring and the barricade. Then he and Ricochet combined for a dangerous Spanish Fly from the second rope through two tables on the outside. The final few minutes were chaotic in a good way as it felt Santos Escobar, Butch and others kept thwarting the three favorite’s attempts to win.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sky’s The Limit</h2><p>Iyo Sky finally turned the tables on Damage CTRL leader Bayley in maybe the most creative way possible. Sky had assisted Bayley at different points during the match, even once after the multi-time women’s champion pushed her off the ladder to spoil her initial shot at the briefcase.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Iyo Sky celebrates winning the women’s Money in the Bank match. <span class=credit>WWE</span></figure><p>She finally had enough and shortly after, Sky got her revenge and her championship contract. It came with help from Zoey Stark and Trish Straus failing to fully handcuff Becky Lynch to something. Instead, Sky cuffed Lynch and Bayley’s arms together between the middle of the ladder before climbing over her partner to win in a poetic moment and a big pop.</p><p>The match itself didn’t have the wild spots the men’s did but told good stories. Stark and Stratus — who has some awkward moments taking and delivering moves — worked together against Lynch. The Man had her own moments with just Stratus — including a Man-handle slam on a ladder. Zelina Vega was the plucky underdog and may have had the move of the match. She hit Stark with her sandal and then delivered a Code Red (used by her cousin Amazing Red) from the top of the ladder onto a ladder propped up by the middle rope.</p><p>In the end, unlike the men’s match, gave fans the winner they wanted and we will see if Bayley doesn’t mess up Sky’s cash-in.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Unexpected Breakup</h2><p>WWE continues to undermine its women’s tag division by breaking up maybe its most formidable squad a little more than a month after they won the belts. Shayna Baszler, unprovoked, turned on long-time friend and partner Ronda Rousey as the former UFC women’s bantamweight champion was about to put her signature arm bar on Liv Morgan to end things. Instead, it opened the door for Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriguez to pin the wounded Rousey after Baszler left to win back their championship.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Shayna Baszler turned on friend and tag partner Ronda Rousey at Money in the Bank. <span class=credit>WWE</span></figure><p>While we have all wondered what a Rousey-Baszler feud would look like — and will likely now see at SummerSlam — this came way too soon and without any foreshadowing in storytelling. It made for a stunned and less enthusiastic reaction from the crowd than it needed. It continued the company playing hot potatoes with the women’s tag belt and gave Rodriguez and Morgan — their best babyface team — a very hollow win.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cena’s pitch</h2><p>John Cena returned for the first time since WrestleMania in a complete surprise. The London crowd was incredible singing every word of this theme song. The 16-time champ thanked the U.K. fans and told them how underappreciated they are. He told them he is trying to bring WrestleMania to London. Cena was interrupted but Grayson Waller, who mocked Cena’s acting and floated WrestleMania in his native Australia instead. Waller has been treated very well by WWE and felt like he belonged in a segment with the legend despite taking an Attitude Adjustment from Cena. Seeds may have been planted.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Grayson Waller and John Cena at Money in the Bank. <span class=credit>WWE</span></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Other Matches</h3><p><strong>Gunther over Matt Riddle to retain the Intercontinental championship (Drew McIntyre returns)</strong></p><p>What a perfect way to bring back Drew McIntyre for the first time since WrestleMania. The Scotsman’s music hit in front of his U.K. fans after Gunther submitted Matt Riddle to retain his Intercontinental championship. The match was quick but entertaining enough as the champ continually weaken Riddle’s storyline ankle injury until his challenger could not take any more and tapped. McIntyre versus Gunther is a perfect SummerSlam match and could spell the end of his reign if WWE wants to start moving Imperium’s leader up the card.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Gunther tapped out Matt Riddle at Money in the Bank. <span class=credit>WWE</span></figure><p><strong>Cody Rhodes over Dominik Mysterio</strong></p><p>A pretty textbook win for Rhodes in a bit of a plodding match that felt like it belonged on “Monday Night Raw” Rhodes surprised Mysterio by taking off his cast, was able to circumvent a few interference attempts by Rhea Ripley and delivered a Cody Cutter and Cross Rhodes for an easy win. With no Brock Lesnar this felt like filler. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Seth Rollins over Finn Balor to retain the World heavyweight championship</strong></p><p>Damian Priest ended up being the star of the match, costing Balor by threatening to cash-in his contract as he was ready to hit the Coup De Gras. Rollins got out of the way and delivered a Stomp to win. While it furthered The Judgement Day story, it felt unfulfilling to the great build-up of Balor trying to right the believed wrong seven years ago in Brooklyn. The match itself was pretty standard centered on rip injury Balor had previously inflicted on him. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Biggest winner: </strong>Jey Uso</p><p><strong>Biggest loser:</strong> Finn Balor</p><p><strong>Best Match: </strong>Women’s Money in the Bank ladder match &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Predictions: </strong>5-2</p><p><strong>Grade:</strong> B+</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3BmaWpfrMSmecyopZ6xXZ67bsDHnmSbmZ6gerOx1aKcsGWamsZuwdKoZKunnZa7br7Eop6nq12exrB50qSwZquklr9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
